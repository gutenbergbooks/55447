<h3><a name="foreword" id="foreword"></a>FOREWORD</h3>

<p class="p2 dropcap">TO attempt, in one volume, to cover the
entire field of present-day poetry in
America, will be recognized the more
readily as impossible when one reflects that in
Mr. Stedman’s American Anthology over five
hundred poets are represented, of whom the
greater number are still living and singing.</p>

<p>One may scarcely hope, then, in the space
of one volume, to include more than a representative
group, even when confining his study
to the work of the younger poets, for within
this class would fall the larger contingent
named above. It has therefore been necessary
to follow a general, though not arbitrary, standard
of chronology, of which the most feasible
seemed that adopted by Mr. Archer in his admirable
study of the English “Poets of the
Younger Generation,”&mdash;the including only of
such as have been born within the last half-century,
and whose place is still in the making.
The few remaining poets whose art has long
since defined itself, such as Mr. Aldrich, Mr.
<!--010.png-->
Stedman, and Mrs. Moulton, need no further
interpretation; nor does the long-acknowledged
work of Mr. Richard Watson Gilder, nor that
of James Whitcomb Riley, whose final criticism
has been pronounced in every heart and at
every hearth.</p>

<p>The work of Mr. Edwin Markham, the poet
of democracy, whose fraternal songs embody
many of the latter-day ideals, and that of John
B. Tabb, the lapidary of modern verse, who
cuts with infinite care his delicate cameos of
thought, were also beyond the chronological
scheme of the volume. Nor of those who fell
within its scope could a selection be made that
would not seem to some invidious, since it
must chance among so great a number that
many would be omitted who should, with equal
right, have been included; it returns, therefore,
to the earlier statement, that one must confine
himself to a representative group, with whose
work he chance to be most familiar, and upon
which he has, therefore, the truer claim to
speak.</p>

<p>It seemed, also, that the volume would have
more value if it gave to a smaller number such
a study as would differentiate and define their
work, rather than to a larger group the passing
comment of a few paragraphs. It was a great
<!--011.png-->
regret, however, that circumstances incident
to the copyrights prevented me from including
the admirable work of William Vaughn Moody,
which reveals by its breadth, penetration, and
purpose, the thinker and not the dreamer. Indeed,
Mr. Moody’s work, in its vitality of touch,
fine imagination, and spiritual idealism, proves
not only the creative poet but one to whom the
nobler offices of Art have been entrusted, and
the critic given to inquiring why the former
times were better than these may well keep his
eye upon the work of Mr. Moody.</p>

<p>It was also a regret that those inexorable
arbiters, space and time, deprived me of the
privilege of including the strongly individual
work of Helen Gray Cone; the artistic, thoughtful
verse of Anna Hempstead Branch; the
sincere and sympathetic song of Virginia
Woodward Cloud; the spiritual verse of Lilian
Whiting, with its interpretation of the higher
imports; the heartening, characteristic notes of
Theodosia Garrison; and the recently issued
poems of Josephine Dodge Daskam, which
prove beyond peradventure that the Muses,
too, were at her christening,&mdash;indeed, the
“Songs of Iseult Deserted,” which form a
group in her volume, are lyrics worthy of any
hand.</p>

<!--012.png-->
<p>Had it been possible in the space at command,
I should also have had pleasure in considering
the work of Frank Dempster Sherman,
who is not only an accomplished lyrist, but who
has divined the heart of the child and set it to
music; the cheer-giving songs of Frank L.
Stanton, fledged with the Southland sunshine
and melody; and the verse-stories of Holman
F. Day, bringing from the pines of Maine their
pungent aroma of humor and pathos. Mr. Day
covers an individual field, representing such
phases of New England life as have been little
celebrated hitherto, even by writers of fiction.
He is familiar with every corner of Maine from
the mountains to the sea, and writes of humanity
in the concrete, sketching his types equally from
the lumber camp or from the sailors and fishermen
of the shore. In his latest volume they
are drawn from the “Kin o’ Ktaadn,” and hold
their way throughout its pages with a reality
provoking both laughter and tears; indeed, one
must seek far to find a keener humor, or one
more infectious, than that of Mr. Day, or a
more sympathetic penetration into the pathos
of life. The heart is the book of his reading,
and, in turn, the heart is the book of his
writing.</p>

<p>There is no attempt in these studies of the
<!--013.png-->
younger poets to group them into schools, to
define them in relation to one another, or
to hazard prophecies concerning them. Each
is considered in his present accomplishment,
whether the work be fresh from the pen, or
come bringing with it the endorsement of time,
since the song of yesterday may carry farther
than that already borne on the wings of the
years, and has equal claim to consideration in
a volume devoted to the work of the younger
singers; for only by such consideration shall
we learn what is being done in our own day.</p>

<h4>RICHARD HOVEY</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">RICHARD HOVEY was a poet of convictions
rather than of fancies, in which
regard he overtopped many of his
contemporaries who were content to be “enamored
architects of airy rhyme.” Hovey was
himself a skilful architect of rhyme, an imaginative
weaver of fancy; but these were not
ends, he does not stand primarily for them.
He stands for comradeship; for taking vows
of one’s own soul; for alliance with the shaping
spirit of things; for a sane, wholesome,
lusty manhood; a hearty, confident surrender
to life.</p>

<p>He is the poet of positivism, virile, objective,
and personal to a Whitmanesque degree, and
answers to many of the qualifications laid
down by Whitman for the testing of an
American poet. His performance is eminently

of the sort to “face the open fields and the
seaside;” it does “absorb into one;” it “animates
to life,” and it is of the people. It
answers also to the query, “Have you vivified
yourself from the maternity of these States?”
for Hovey was an American of the Americans,
and his patriotic poems are instinct with
national pride, though one may dissent from
certain of his opinions upon war.</p>

<p>Hovey, to the degree of his development
when his hand was stayed, was a finely balanced
man and artist. The purely romantic motives
which form the entire basis, for example, of
Stephen Phillips’ work, and thus render him
a poet of the cultured classes and not of the
people, were foreign to the spirit of Hovey.
He, too, was recasting in dramatic form some
of beauty’s imperishable traditions; but this
was only one phase of his art, it did not cause
him to approach his own time with less of
sympathy; and while he had not yet come
deeply into the prophet gifts of song, their
potency was upon him, and in the Odes, which
contain some of his strongest writing, his passion
for brotherhood, for development through
comradeship, finds splendid expression. In the
best known of his odes, “Spring,” occurs this
stirring symbol:</p>

<p>It is in this ode, with the exception of his
visioning of “Night” in <cite>Last Songs from Vagabondia</cite>,
that the influence of Whitman upon
Hovey comes out most prominently; that is,
the influence of manner. The really vital influence
is one much less easily demonstrated,
but no less apparent to a student of both
poets. It is not of the sort, however, to detract
from the originality of Hovey, but rather an
intensifying of his characteristics, a focalizing
of his powers, and is in accordance with Whitman’s
declaration that</p>

</div><!--end container-->

<p>Hovey’s own nature was so individual that he
rarely failed to destroy the teacher, or he was
perhaps unconscious of having one; but in
the opening lines of the ode in question the
Whitman note is unmistakable:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

</div><!--end container-->

<p>Could volumes of conventional nature poetry
set one a-tingle like this? The crowning excellence
of Hovey’s nature poems is that they
are never reports, they do not describe with
far-sought imagery, but are as personal as a
poem of love or other emotion. Such passionate
surrender, such intimate delight as finds
expression, for example, in “The Faun,” could
scarcely be more communicative and direct.
It becomes at once our own mood, an interchange
which is the test of art:</p>

<p>a line wherein the idea, feeling, movement, and
diction are wholly at one. It is impossible for
Richard Hovey to be aloof and analytical in
any phase of his work, and when he writes of
nature it is as the comrade to whom she
is a mystic personality. A stanza of “The
Faun” illustrates this; still in the wood, he
asks:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Oh, what is it breathes in the air?</div>
  <div class="verse">Oh, what is it touches my cheek?</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">But where?</div>
  <div class="verse">Is it far, is it far to seek?</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The first two collections of the <cite>Vagabondia</cite>
books contain Hovey’s most spontaneous nature
verse; they have also some of the lyrics by
which he will be known when such a rollicking
stave as “Barney McGee,” at which one laughs
<!--024.png-->
as a boyish exuberance, is forgotten. The
quips of rhyme and fancy that enliven the
pages of the earlier volumes give place, in
the <cite>Last Songs</cite>, to a note of seriousness and
artistic purpose which sets the collection to an
entirely different key; not that the work is
uniformly superior to that of the former songs,
but it is more earnest in tone; dawn is giving
place to noon.</p>

<p>From the second collection may be cited one
of the lyric inspirations that sometimes came to
Hovey, all warmth and color, as if fashioned
complete in a thought. It is called “A Sea
Gypsy,” and the first of its quatrains, though
perhaps not more than the others, has a haunting
charm:</p>

<!--025.png-->
<p>Aside from the dramas, and the noble elegy,
“Seaward,” Hovey’s most representative work
is found in his collection, <cite>Along the Trail</cite>,
which opens with a group of battle-hymns
inspired by the Spanish-American war. With
the exception of “Unmanifest Destiny,” and occasional
trumpet notes from the poem called
“Bugles,” these battle-songs are more or less
perfunctory, nor are they ethically the utterance
of a prophet. There is the old assumption
that because war has ever been, it ever
will be; that because the sword has been the
instrument of progress in past world-crises, it is
the divinely chosen arbiter. There is nothing
of that development of man that shall find a
higher way, no visioning of a world-standard
to which nations shall conform; it is rather
the celebration of brawn, as in the sonnet
“America.” The jubilant note of his call of the
“Bugles,” however, thrills with passionate pride
in his country as the deliverer of the weak,
for the ultimate idea in Hovey’s mind was
his country’s altruism; but, as a whole, the
battle-songs lack the larger vision and are unequal
in workmanship, falling constantly into
the commonplace from some flight of lyric
beauty. The best of them, and a worthy
best, both in conception and in its dignified

<p>Hovey’s themes are widely diverse, but they
are always of the essential purports. He seems
not only integral with nature, but integral with
man in his ardor of sympathy for his fellows,
and the swift understanding of all that makes
for achievement or defeat. He had the splendid
nonchalance that met everything with
confident ease, and made his relation to life
like that of an athlete trained to prevail. Not
to be servile, not to be negative, not to be
vague,&mdash;these are some of the notes of his
stirring song. Even in love there is a characteristic
dash and <em>verve</em>, a celebration of comradeship
as the keynote of the relation, that
makes it possible for him to write this sonnet,
so refreshing and wholesome, and so far removed
from the mawkish or effeminate:</p>

<p>“The Quest of Merlin,” Hovey’s first incursion
into drama, and indeed one of his earliest
works, having been issued in 1891, is most
illustrative of his defects and least of his distinctions.
It is unnecessary to the subsequent
dramas, though serving as an introduction to
them, and has in itself very little constructive
congruity. In the songs of the fairies, the
dryads, the maenads, there is often a delicate
airy beauty; but the metrical lapses throughout
the drama are so frequent as to detract from
one’s pleasure in the verse. This criticism is
much less apposite to the subsequent works
of the cycle.</p>

<p>Hovey’s Arthurian dramas must be judged
by the manner rather than motif, by the situations
through which he develops the well-known
story, and the dramatic beauty and passion of
the dialogue, since the theme is his only as
he makes it his by the art of his adaptation.
He has given us the Arthur of Malory, and
not of Tennyson, the Arthur of a certain early
<!--030.png-->
intrigue with Morgance, the Queen of Orkney,
outlived in all save its effect, that of bitterness
and envy cherished by her against the young
Queen Guinevere, and made use of as one of
the motives of the drama.</p>

<p>While Tennyson’s Arthur, until the final
great scene with Guinevere in the convent,
and Bedivere by the lake, has a lay-figure personality,
placidly correct, but unconvincing,&mdash;in
these scenes, and in the general ideal of the
Round Table, as developed by Tennyson, there
is such profound spiritual beauty that Arthur
has come to dwell in a nebulous upper air, as
of the gods. It is a shock, then, to see him
brought down to earth, as he is in Hovey’s
dramas. However, the lapses are but referred
to as incidental to the plot, not occurring during
its action, and Arthur becomes to us a human,
magnanimous personality, commanding sympathy,
if he does not dominate the imagination
as does Tennyson’s hero. The handicap under
which any poet labors who makes use of these
legends, even though vitalizing them with a
new touch, and approaching them from a new
standpoint, is that the Tennyson touch, the
Tennyson standpoint, has so impressed itself
upon the memory that comparison is inevitable.</p>

<!--031.png-->
<p>The fateful passion of Lancelot and Guinevere
is enveloped by Tennyson in a spiritual
atmosphere; but in the dramas of Hovey, while
delicately approached, it lacks that elevation by
which alone it lives as a soul-tragedy, and not
as an intrigue. There is, indeed, a strife for
loyalty on the part of Lancelot, when he returns
from a chivalrous quest and learns that
the King’s bride is his unknown Lady of the
Hills; but it is soon overborne by Galahault’s
assurance that Arthur is to Guinevere&mdash;</p>

<p>Ere this declaration, Lancelot, in conflict with

<p>he is persuaded to seek her, and, ere the close
of the interview, half confessions have orbed to
full acknowledgment by each. The scene is
artistically handled, especially in the ingenuous
simplicity of Guinevere.</p>

<p>Hovey occasionally makes the mistake of
robbing some vital utterance of its dramatic
value by interlarding it with ornament. True
emotion is not literary, and Guinevere, meeting
Lancelot alone at the lodge of Galahault, for
the first time after their mutual confession, having
come hither disguised and by a perilous
course, would scarcely have chosen these decorative
words:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Oh, do not jar with speech</div>
  <div class="verse">This perfect chord of silence!&mdash;Nay, there needs</div>

  <div class="verse">Like pearls between thy kisses;</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>and Lancelot, of the overmastering passion,
would scarcely have babbled this reply:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Thy speech breaks</div>

<p>But when the crisis of the play is reached,
when the court is rife with rumors of the
Queen’s disloyalty, and Lancelot and Guinevere,
under imminent shadow of exposure, meet by
chance in the throne room,&mdash;there is drawn a
vital, moving picture, one whose art lies in
revealing the swift transition from impulse
to impulse through which one passes when
making great decisions. First, the high light is

<p>This swift change of front, this weakening,
this inconsistency, is yet so human, so subtly

<p>No surplusage, no interposition of the merely

<p>The opportunity for a great dramatic effect
is obvious; but through the magnanimity of
Arthur, in waiving the impeachment, and exonerating

from suspicion the Queen and Lancelot,
the effect is not of the clash and din order, in
fact, it is anti-climax in action, the real climax

<p>Whatever one may think of the ethical side of
the play as wrought out by Hovey, there is no
question of its human element. As a whole,
“The Marriage of Guenevere” leaves upon
one a more concrete and vital impression than
do the other dramas of the cycle, though it
has less of action and intricacy of plot than
the succeeding one, “The Birth of Galahad,”
and would probably, for stage purposes, be less
effective.</p>

<p>The action of the latter play takes place
chiefly with Arthur’s army occupied in the siege
of Rome, and unfolds an ingenious plot, turning
<!--038.png-->
upon the capture of Dagonet, the Queen’s
jester, who has been sent with a letter to Lancelot,
informing him of the birth of his son, and
announcing that Guinevere, having left the
child with her friend, the Princess Ylen, had
set out to join the army. The Romans at once
conceive the plan of holding Dagonet; capturing
the Queen for the palace of Caesar; and
giving to Lancelot the alternative of forsaking
Arthur, placing himself at the head of the
army and becoming tributary king of Britain,
with Guinevere as his queen; or of being publicly
dishonored by the conveyance to Arthur
of the incriminating letter. All of which was
artfully planned, and might have been executed
as artfully, had not Dagonet, the jester, in an
act of jugglery, stolen the Emperor’s cloak and
escaped, and, in the guise of a scrivener, attached
himself to the service of a young poet
of Caesar’s household.</p>

<p>Guinevere is captured by the Romans, and after
many unsuccessful machinations on Caesar’s part
to subdue her to his will, and on the part of his
advisers to win Lancelot to their ends, the letter,
which may, according to the law of Britain,
bring death to the Queen and banishment to
Lancelot, is given to Dagonet to copy for Caesar,
and is burned by the jester with the taper given
<!--039.png-->
him to heat the waxen tablet. Then comes
on apace the sacking of Rome by Arthur; the
taking of the city; the rescue of Guinevere
by Lancelot; the slaying of Caesar and the
crowning of Arthur as Emperor of Rome
with Guinevere as Empress. The scene closes
with the entrance of a messenger with letters
from Merlin, to Arthur and Guinevere, scanning
which the Queen says apart to Lancelot:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">All’s well with him.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>Thus ends the drama, again with no suspicion
on the part of Arthur that his faith has been
betrayed, and with no remorse on the part of
Guinevere at having betrayed it, only increasing
joy in the love of Lancelot. It is Lancelot
himself who has the conflict, and in his character
lies the strength of the drama.</p>

<p>It is evident that Hovey intended to create
a flesh-and-blood Arthur, to eliminate the sanctimonious
and retain the ideal; but the task
proved too difficult, and after opening the
reader’s eyes to the human weaknesses of the
King, thereby inflicting a shock, he returns to
the other extreme, lifts him again into upper
air, and leaves him abstract and unconvincing.
Lancelot, on the contrary, if too palpably human
<!--040.png-->
at the start, grows into a more spiritual ideal,
and when for the first time he meets Guinevere
transfigured with maternal joy, he greets her
with these exquisite words:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">How great a mystery you seem to me</div>
  <div class="verse">I cannot tell. You seem to have become</div>
  <div class="verse">One with the tides and night and the unknown.</div>
  <div class="verse">My child … your child … whence come? By</div>
  <div class="verse">What strange forge</div>
  <div class="verse">Wrought of ourselves and dreams and the great deep</div>
  <div class="verse">Into a life? I feel as if I stood</div>
  <div class="verse">Where God had passed by, leaving all the place</div>
  <div class="verse">Aflame with him.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>And again he says,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The strangeness is</div>
  <div class="verse">That I, who have not borne him, am aware,</div>
  <div class="verse">I, too, of intimacy with his soul.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The dramas abound in quotable passages, nor
are they lacking in those that make the judicious
grieve. The work is unequal; but as a whole
it lives in the imagination, and remains in the
memory, especially “The Marriage of Guenevere,”
in that twilight of the mind where dwell
all mystic shapes of hapless lovers.</p>

<p>The last of the dramatic cycle, “The Masque
of Taliesin,” is regarded by most of Mr. Hovey’s
critics as the high-water mark of his verse, and
it has certainly some of the purest song of his
<!--041.png-->
pen, and profoundest in thought and conception;
but it has also passages of unresolved
metaphysics, whose place, unless the poet had
the patience to shape them to a finer issue,
should be in a Greek philosophy.</p>

<p>The Masque turns upon the quest of the
Graal by Percival, and is in three scenes, or
movements, set in the forest of Broceliande,
Helicon, and the Chapel of the Graal. It introduces
the Muses, Merlin, Apollo, Nimue, King
Evelac, guardian of the Graal, and lesser mortals
and deities, but chief in interest, Taliesin, a
bard, through whom are spoken the finest passages
of the play. As the work is cast in the
form of a Masque, to obviate the need of adhering
to a strict dramatic structure, one may dispense
with a summary of its slight plot, and
look, instead, at the verse.</p>

<p>The passages spoken by Apollo to Taliesin,
in other words, Inspiration defining itself to the
poet, are full of glowing thought:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Greaten thyself to the end, I am he for whose breath thou art greatened;</div>
  <div class="verse">Perfect thy speech to a god’s, I am he for whom speech is made perfect;</div>
  <div class="verse">And my voice in the hush of thy heart is the voice of the tides of the worlds.</div>
  <div class="verse">Thou shalt know it is I when I speak, as the foot knows the rock that it treads on,</div>
<!--042.png-->
  <div class="verse">As the sea knows the moon, as the sap knows the place of the sun in the heavens,</div>
  <div class="verse">As the cloud knows the cloud it must meet and embrace with caresses of lightning.</div>
  <div class="verse">When thou hearest my voice, thou art one with the hurl of the stars through the void,</div>
  <div class="verse">One with the shout of the sea and the stampede of droves of the wind,</div>
  <div class="verse">One with the coursers of Time and the grip of God’s hand on their harness;</div>
  <div class="verse">And the powers of the night and the grave shall avail not to stand in thy path.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Genius and its invincible assurance could
scarcely be defined better than in this passage.</p>

<p>The Masque contains a litany spoken by
King Evelac, and responded to by the choristers
at the Chapel of Graal, which is one of
its achievements, in point of beauty, though
too long to quote, and lyrics of great delicacy
are scattered throughout the work; but in
the more spiritual passages, spoken chiefly by
Taliesin, one gets the finer quality of the verse,
as in this noble query addressed to Uriel, the
angel who holds the flaming sword before the
Graal:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Thou who beholdest God continually,</div>
  <div class="verse">Doth not his light shine even on the blind</div>
  <div class="verse">Who feel the flood they lack the sense to see?</div>
  <div class="verse">The lark that seeks him in the summer sky</div>
  <div class="verse">Finds there the great blue mirror of his soul;</div>
<!--043.png-->
  <div class="verse">Winged with the dumb need of he knows not what,</div>
  <div class="verse">He finds the mute speech of he knows not whom.</div>
  <div class="verse">Is not the wide air, after the cocoon,</div>
  <div class="verse">As much God as the moth-soul can receive?</div>
  <div class="verse">Doth not God give the child within the womb</div>
  <div class="verse">Some guess to set him groping for the world,</div>
  <div class="verse">Some blurred reflection answering his desire?</div>
  <div class="verse">We, shut in this blue womb of doming sky,</div>
  <div class="verse">Guess and grope dimly for the vast of God,</div>
  <div class="verse">And, eyeless, through some vague, less perfect sense,</div>
  <div class="verse">Strive for a sign of what it is to see.</div>

<p>Had one space to follow Mr. Hovey’s philosophy
in the more metaphysical passages,
though fashioned less artistically, the individuality
of his thought in its subtler and more
speculative phases would be revealed, but to
trace it adequately one must needs have the
volume before him, rather than such extracts as
may be given in a brief study. I must therefore,
in taking leave of his work, content myself
with citing the exultant lines with which the
volume closes, the splendid death-song lifting
one on the wave of its ecstatic feeling:</p>

<h4>LIZETTE WOODWORTH REESE</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">MISS LIZETTE WOODWORTH
REESE is an Elizabethan, not by
affectation, but by temperament.
Sidney and Lovelace and Herrick and Marlowe
are her contemporaries, though she moves
among them as a gray-robed figure among gay
cavaliers and knights, so restrained is her
mood, so delicate in its withholding.</p>

<p>Her first collection is aptly named, <cite>A
Handful of Lavender</cite>, for the fragrance of
the elder time pervades it impalpably, as the
scent of lavender makes sweet the linen of
some treasured chest. How Miss Reese has
been able, in the hurly-burly of American life,
to find some indesecrate corner, some daffodiled
garden-close, holding always the quiet
and the glint of sunshine out of which these
songs have come, is an enigma worth a
poet’s solving. She is a Southern woman,
which may furnish some clew to the repose of
her work. There is time down there to ripen,
to let life have its own way of enrichment with
<!--046.png-->
one. She has been content to publish three
books of verse&mdash;although the first is now incorporated
with the second&mdash;in the interval
in which our Northern poets would have produced
a half-dozen; nor does she much concern
herself, when once the captive melodies
are freed, as to their flight. She knows there
are magnetic breezes in the common air,
charméd winds that blow unerringly, and in
whose upper currents song’s wings are guided,
as the carrier-doves’, to their appointed goal.</p>

<p>There is a delicate harmony between Miss
Reese’s poems and their number, a nicety of
adjustment between quality and quantity, that
bespeaks the artist. She has the critic’s gift of
appraising her own work before it leaves her
hand, and thus forestalls much of the criticism
that might otherwise attend it. The faculty
of self-analysis would be a safety-valve to
the high-pressure speed at which most literature
of to-day is produced&mdash;but, alas, the few
that employ it! “Open the throttle and let it
drive!” is the popular injunction to the genius
within, and wherever it drives, one is expected
to follow. How refreshing it is, then, to come
upon work with calm upon it!&mdash;work that
came out of time, culture, and artist-love, and
trusts its appreciation to the same standards.</p>

<!--048.png-->
<!--049.png-->
<p>Miss Reese’s verse shows constant affinity
with Herrick, though it is rarely so blithe. It
has the singing mood, but not the buoyant
one, being tempered by something delicate and
remote. The unheard melodies within it are
the sweetest; it pipes to the spirit “ditties of
no tone.” Even its least rare fancies convey
more than they say, and it must be confessed
that much so-called poetry says more than it
conveys. Whitman’s mystical words: “All
music is what awakes from you when you are
reminded by the instruments,” applies equally
well to poetry, to poetry of suggestion, such as
Miss Reese’s. Yesterday’s parted grace has
been transmuted to poetry within us all, but
it is a voiceless possession, speaking to us
in the soul. Miss Reese’s poems, by a line
or two, perhaps, put one in swift possession
of that vanishing beauty within himself. It
floods back, perchance in tears, but it is ours
again. Take almost a random citation, for
this quality is rarely absent from her poems,
whether they summon Joy or Pain,&mdash;her lines
“To A White Lilac”:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">I know you, ghost of some lone, delicate hour,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Long-gone but unforgot;</div>
  <div class="verse">Wherein I had for guerdon and for dower</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">That one thing I have not.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
<!--050.png-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Unplucked I leave your mystical white feather,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">O phantom up the lane;</div>
  <div class="verse">For back may come that spent and lovely weather,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And I be glad again!</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>To analyze this, would be to pluck the mystical
white feather that a poet left untouched,
that it might recall the grace of “some lone,
delicate hour, long-gone but unforgot;” but
the soul of such an hour has subtilized for each
of us in that spiritual memory-flower, and it
needs no more than the opening line of this
poem to invest the disillusioned day with a
mood the same&mdash;yet not the same. Miss
Reese has put it in two lines in her “Song of
the Lavender Woman”:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Oh, my heart, why should you break at any thoughts like these?</div>
  <div class="verse">So sooth are they of the old time that they should bring you ease.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>In another brief poem, the spirit of grief, that
transmutes itself at last to music, to odor, to
sunsets and dawns, becomes vital again in the
scent of the box, the garden shrub. The lines
show Miss Reese’s susceptibility to impression
from the most intangible sources:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Dark, thinned, beside the wall of stone,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">The box dripped in the air;</div>
  <div class="verse">Its odor through my house was blown</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Into the chamber there.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
<!--051.png-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Remote and yet distinct the scent,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">The sole thing of the kind,</div>
  <div class="verse">As though one spoke a word half meant</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">That left a sting behind.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">I knew not Grief would go from me</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And naught of it be plain,</div>
  <div class="verse">Except how keen the box can be</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">After a fall of rain.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>Miss Reese’s art is its apparent lack of art,
of conscious effort. Her diction is as simple
in the mere store of words which she chooses
to employ, as might be that of some poet to
whom such a store was his sole equipment;
but what is that fine distinction between <em>simplesse</em>
and <em>simplicité</em>? One recognizes in her
vocabulary the subtlest art of choice and elimination,
art that is temperament, however, that
selects by intuitive fitness and not by formulas
or deliberate trying of effects. The words
she employs are thrice distilled and clarified,
until they become the essence of lucidity, and
this essence in turn is crystallized into form in
her poems. Perhaps they have, for some, too
little warmth and color; they are not the rich-dyed
words of passion, they are rather the
white, delicate words of memory, but no others
would serve as well.</p>

<p>In reading certain poems of Miss Reese’s,
<!--052.png-->
such as “Trust,” or her lines “Writ In A Book
Of Elizabethan Verse,” the clarity of the language
recalls a passage in a letter of Jean
Ingelow’s in which she exclaims: “Oh that
I might wash my words in light!” The impression
which many of these lyrics convey is
that Miss Reese <em>has</em> washed her words in light,
so clear, so pure is their beauty. Take, for illustration,
the much-quoted lines “Love Came
Back At Fall O’ Dew,” and note the art and
feeling achieved almost wholly in monosyllabic
words:</p>

<p>A lyric imbued with charm, and into which a
heart history is compressed, and yet employing
but five or six words of more than one syllable!
Is this not clarifying to a purpose? The lines
<!--053.png-->
called “Trust,” illustrate with equal minuteness
the gift of putting into the simplest words
some truth that seems to speak itself without
calling attention to language or form, and,
though having less of charm, they illustrate
the point in question, that of absolute simplicity
without insipidity. This is not, however,
to be taken as advice to all poets to
cultivate the monosyllabic style. Because Miss
Reese can achieve such an effect through it,
when she chooses, as “Love Came Back At
Fall O’ Dew,” does not argue that another
poet would not corrupt it to nursery babble,
nor would it be desirable to strive for it in
any case. Song is impulse, not effort, and
back of it is temperament. Miss Reese is a
poet-<em>singer</em>; she is at her best in the pure lyric,
the lyric that could be sung, and therefore her
most artistic poems are such as are the least
ornate, but have rare distinction in the purity,
fitness, and individuality of her words.</p>

<p>Very few modern lyrics possess the singing
quality. The term “lyric verse,” as used
to-day, is a misnomer. It is as intricate in
form and phrase as if not consecrated to the
lyre by poets in the dawn of art. The divorce
between poetry and song grows more absolute
year by year; composers search almost vainly
<!--054.png-->
through modern volumes of verse for lyrics
that combine the melody and feeling, the
spontaneity and grace, indispensable to song.
It is not that the modern poet is unable to
produce such, but that he does not choose.
It has gone out of fashion, to state the case
quite frankly, to write with a singing cadence;
something rare and strange must issue from
the poet’s lips, something inobvious. Art
lurks in surprises, and the poet of to-day must
be a diviner of mysteries, a searcher of secrets,
in nature and humanity and truth, and a revealer
of them in his art, though he reveal
ofttimes but to conceal.</p>

<p>Poetry grows more and more an intellectual
pleasure for the cultured classes, less and less a
possession of the people. Elizabethan song
was upon the lips of the milkmaids and market-women,
the common ear was trained to grace
and melody; but how many of the country folk
of to-day know the involved numbers of our
poets, or, knowing, could grasp them? Who is
writing the lays of the people? One can only
answer that few are writing them because the
spirit of poetic art has suffered a sea-change
into something rich and strange, and the poet
of to-day would be fearful of his laurels should
he write so artless a song as “Gather ye rosebuds
<!--055.png-->
while ye may,” or “Come live with me and
be my love,” and yet these are beads that
Time tells over on the rosary of Art.</p>

<p>The question is too broad to discuss here.
We should all agree, doubtless, as to the increasing
separation between poetry and song,
the increasing tendency of verse to appeal to
the cultured classes; but as to the desirability
of returning to the simpler form, adapting
theme and melody to the common ear&mdash;how
many modern poets would agree upon that?
There is a middle ground, however; the reaction
against the highly ornate is already felt,
and a finer art may be trusted to bring its own
adjustments until poetry will again become of
universal appeal.</p>

<p>And how does this pertain to Miss Reese?
It pertains in that her ideal is the very return
to clear, sympathetic song of which we have
spoken. She would recapture the blitheness
of Herrick, the valor of Lovelace, would lighten
song’s wings of their heaviness and shift Care
and Wisdom to more prosaic burden-bearers.
While the reminiscent mood is prevalent in her
work, it is not melancholy, but has rather the
iridescent glint of smiles and tears. Joy never
quite departs, although “with finger at his lip,
bidding adieu.” Miss Reese’s strife is toward
<!--056.png-->
a valiant cheer, whose passing she deplores in
the poem called “Laughter”:</p>

  <div class="verse indent2">Thus we set it out of reach.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>There is heartier food than ambrosia in this
stanza. It is true that when we use the crocus
for a text we set it out of reach, or, in common
phrase, when poetry becomes didactic, Art flees.
A dew-fresh song would teach the crocus’ lesson,
or many another lesson, without a hint of teaching
it, merely by beauty; by the creed of Keats.
Pope’s didactic, sententious lines are gone; but
Keats, who never pointed a moral in his life,
sings on eternally. Miss Reese too is votary
to beauty for its own sake; she gives one the
flower, and he may extract the nectar for himself.
The nectar is always there for one’s distilling
into the truth which is the essence of
<!--057.png-->
things. She does not herself extract and distil
it, for hers is the art of suggestion.</p>

<p>Having this creed of song, Miss Reese’s
themes are not widely inclusive. They are,
however, the universal themes,&mdash;love, beauty,
reverence, remembrance, joy that has been
tempered to cheer, having met pain by the way;
for, as we have said, no encounter with pain&mdash;and
her poems give abundant evidence of
such encounter&mdash;has been able to subdue the
valor of her spirit, or to quench the joy at
the springs of her feeling, albeit the buoyant,
brimful joy has given place to acquiescent
cheer.</p>

<p>There is a certain quality in Miss Reese’s
poems, a quaintness, an elder grace, that is
wholly unique. It is the union of theme,
phraseology, and atmosphere. The two former
have been considered, but the spirit, after all, is
in the last, in that which analysis cannot reach.
One selects a poem from <cite>A Quiet Road</cite> illustrative
of this art of correlating Then and Now,
making quick the dead in memory and hope,
and sets about to analyze it,&mdash;when, lo, as if one
had prisoned a white butterfly, it escapes, leaving
only the dust of its wing in one’s hand!
Miss Reese’s poems are not to be analyzed, they
are to be felt; that, too, is the creed of her song.

Is it difficult to feel these delicate lines called
“The Road of Remembrance”?&mdash;</p>

<p>Miss Reese’s growth, as shown in her two
volumes, is so marked that while <cite>A Handful
of Lavender</cite> has the foreshadowing of her
later work, and also some notably fine poems,&mdash;such
as “That Day You Came,” “The Last
Cricket,” “A Spinning Song,” and “The
Old Path,”&mdash;it has not the same perfectly
individual note that pervades <cite>A Quiet Road</cite>.
The personal mark, the artist-proof mark, upon
nearly everything in the later collection, is frequently
<!--059.png-->
absent from the first. That part of
<cite>A Handful of Lavender</cite> first issued as <cite>A
Branch of May</cite> is naturally the least finished
of Miss Reese’s work. It is unsure and yet
indicative of that&mdash;</p>

<p>which shines in her later work.</p>

<p>“The Death Potion,” from the first collection,
is a case in point: it is strong in idea, and
here and there in execution, but its metre is
faulty, and it departs so often from the initial
measure that one who has set himself in tune
with that is thrown from the key, and in adapting
himself to the changed rhythm loses the
pleasure of the poem.</p>

<p>It must be said, however, that such lack of
metrical sensitiveness is very rare even in the
earlier poems. In general, they are of unimpeachable
rhythm; indeed, the singing note is
so much Miss Reese’s natural expression that
it creeps into this sonnet, “The Old Path,”
and turns it in effect to a lyric:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">O Love! O Love! this way has hints of you</div>

  <div class="verse">And when the wind, just now, came soft and fleet,</div>

  <div class="verse">Have you, for me that love you, thought or word?</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Do I, with bud or bough, pass by your way;</div>
  <div class="verse">With any breath of brier or note of bird?</div>

</div><!--end poem container-->

<p><cite>A Handful of Lavender</cite> shows the tendency
of most young poets to affect the sonnet, a tendency
laudable enough if one be a natural sonneteer.
Miss Reese has many finely conceived
and well-executed sonnets, but few that are
unforgettably fine, as are many of her lyrics.
That she recognizes wherein her surest power
lies is obvious from the fact that, whereas <cite>A
Handful of Lavender</cite> contains some thirty-two
sonnets, <cite>A Quiet Road</cite> contains but twelve.
Those of nature predominated in the former,
nature for its own sake; but in the latter there
is far less accent upon nature and more upon
life.</p>

<p>They show in technique, also, Miss Reese’s
firmer, surer touch and greater clarity. There
are certain sonnets in <cite>A Handful of Lavender</cite>,
such as “A Song of Separation,” and “Renunciation,”
warmer in feeling than the later ones
<!--061.png-->
and equal to them in manner; but in general
the mechanism is much more apparent&mdash;one
<em>does</em> occasionally see the wires, which is never
the case in the later work.</p>

<p>“The Look of the Hedge,” or these lines
called “Recompense,” will illustrate the ease
and lucidity of her sonnets in <cite>A Quiet Road</cite>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Sometimes, yea, often, I forget, forget;</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Pass your closed door with not a thought of you,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Of the old days, but only of these new;</div>
  <div class="verse">I sow; I reap; my house in order set.</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Then of a sudden doth this thing befall,</div>
  <div class="verse">By a wood’s edge, or in the market-place,</div>
  <div class="verse">That I remember naught but your dead face,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And other folk forgotten, you are all.</div>
  <div class="verse">When this is so, oh, sooth the time and sweet!</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And I, thereafter, am like unto one</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">Who from the lilac bloom and the young year</div>
  <div class="verse">Comes to a chamber shuttered from the street,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Yet heeds nor emptiness nor lack of sun,</div>

<p>There are excellently wrought sonnets in the
first volume, indeed, the majority of them are
not without fine lines or true feeling, but
the gain in command of the form has been
marked. When all is said, however, one comes
back to <cite>A Quiet Road</cite> for the songs it holds,
and for these he treasures it. Miss Reese has
epitomized, in her lines “Writ In A Book Of
<!--062.png-->
Elizabethan Verse,” her own characteristics
under those of the earlier singers, sounded the
delicate notes of her own reed, when she says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="verse">Mine is the crocus and the call</div>
  <div class="verse">Of gust to gust in shrubberies tall;</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">And mine the unforgetting thrush</div>
  <div class="verse">That pours its heart-break from the wall.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">For I am tears, for I am Spring,</div>
  <div class="verse">The old and immemorial thing;</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">Under the swaying cherry-trees,</div>
  <div class="verse">From east and west remembering.</div>

  <div class="verse">O elder Hour, when I am not,</div>
  <div class="verse">Gone out like smoke from road and plot,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">More perfect Hour of light and dew,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Shall lovers turn away from you,</div>
  <div class="verse">And long for me, the Unforgot!</div>

<p>Surely they will, for clear, pure song keeps
its vibrancy, and the note to which is set
the quaintness of such words as these in
Miss Reese’s poem “A Pastoral,” will not
easily be forgotten:</p>

  <div class="verse">Oho, my love, oho, my love, and ho, the bough that shows,</div>

<h3><a name="Carman" id="Carman"></a><abbr title="Three">III</abbr></h3>

<h4>BLISS CARMAN</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">THE presence of Mr. Carman, a Canadian
singer, among a group of poets of the
States, needs no explanation; so identified
is he with the artistic life of the younger
generation on this side the border that we have
come to forget his earlier allegiance, and to
consider his work, most of which has been produced
here, as distinctly our own. But while
it is gratifying to feel that so much of his verse
has drawn its inspiration from nature and life
as we know them, one could little spare Mr.
Carman’s first book of lyrics, <cite>Low Tide on
Grand Pré</cite>, which is purely Canadian&mdash;set in
the air of the “blue North summer.”</p>

<p>It lacks as a collection the confident touch
of his later work, but is imbued with an indefinable
delicacy; it withholds the uttermost word,
and its grace is that of suggestion. Especially
is this true of the initial poem, a lyric with a
poignant undernote calling one back thrice
and again to learn its spell.</p>

<!--067.png-->
<p>It has been Mr. Carman’s method to issue at
intervals small volumes containing work of a
related sort; but it is open to question whether
this method of publishing, with the harmony
which results from grouping each collection
under a certain key, may not have a counterbalancing
danger in the tendency toward
monotony. As a matter of fact, Mr. Carman
has a wide range of subject; but unless one be
ever taking a bird’s-eye view of his work, it is
likely to seem restricted, owing to the reiterance
of the same note in whatever collection he
chance to have in hand. A case in point is
that furnished by <cite>Ballads of Lost Haven</cite>, one of
his most characteristic and fascinating volumes,
a very wizardy of sea moods, yet it has no fewer
than four poems, succeeding one another at the
close of the collection, prefiguring death under
the titles of “The Shadow Boatswain,” “The
Master of the Isles,” “The Last Watch,” and
“Outbound.”</p>

<p>Each of these is blended of mystery, lure, and
dread; each conveys the feeling it was meant
to convey; but when the four poems of similar
motive are grouped together, their force is lost.
The symbols which seem in each to rise as spontaneously
from the sea as its own foam, lose their
magic when others of like import, but different
<!--068.png-->
phrasing, crowd closely upon them. For illustration,
the “Shadow Boatswain” contains
these fine lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Don’t you know the sailing orders?</div>
  <div class="verse">It is time to put to sea,</div>
  <div class="verse">And the stranger in the harbor</div>
  <div class="verse">Sends a boat ashore for me.</div>

  <div class="verse">&middot;&emsp;&emsp;&middot;&emsp;&emsp;&middot;&emsp;&emsp;&middot;&emsp;&emsp;&middot;</div>

  <div class="verse">That’s the Doomkeel. You may know her</div>
  <div class="verse">By her clean run aft; and then</div>
  <div class="verse">Don’t you hear the Shadow Boatswain</div>

<p>And “The Master of the Isles,” immediately
following, opens in this equally picturesque,
but essentially similar, manner:</p>

  <div class="verse">There is rumor in Dark Harbor,</div>
  <div class="verse">And the folk are all astir;</div>

<p>While each of the poems develops differently,
and taken alone has a symbolistic beauty that
would fix itself in the memory, when the two
are put together and are followed by two others
cognate in theme, the lines of relief have melted
into one indistinct image. This effect of blurring
<!--071.png-->
from the grouping of related poems is not
so apparent in any collection as in the sea
ballads, as the subject-matter of the other volumes
is more diversified and the likelihood
of employing somewhat the same imagery is
therefore removed; but while Mr. Carman has
a very witchery of phrase when singing of the
sea, and his words sting one with delight like
a dash of brine, one would, for that very reason,
keep the impression vivid, forceful, complete,
and grudges the merging of it into others and
yet others that shall dissipate it or transform it
to an impalpable thing.</p>

<p>Judging them individually, it is doubtful if
Mr. Carman has done anything more representative,
more imbued with his own temperament,
than these buoyant, quickening songs that
freshen one as if from a plunge in the sea,
and take one to themselves as intimately. The
opening poem sets the key to the collection:</p>

<p>or, “To the sag of an idle sheet,” which fixes
at once the impression of a sultry, languorous
air, one of those, half-veiled, “weather-breeder”
days one knows so well.</p>

<p>From a narrative standpoint the ballads are
spirited, there is always a story worth telling;
but they are occasionally marred by Mr. Carman’s
prolixity, the besetting sin of his art. He
who can crowd so much into a line is often
lacking in the faculty of its appraisal, and frequently
<!--075.png-->
a crisp, telling phrase or stanza is
weakened by the accretion that gathers around
it. Beauty is rarely wanting in this accretion,
but beauty that is not organic, not structurally
necessary to the theme, becomes verbiage.
Walter Pater has said it all in his fine passage:
“For in truth all art does but consist in the
removal of surplusage, from the last finish of the
gem-engraver blowing away the last particle of
invisible dust, back to the earliest divination
of the finished work to be, lying somewhere,
according to Michael Angelo’s fancy, in the
rough-hewn block of stone.” It is not Mr.
Carman’s divination of the finished work to be
that is at fault; one feels that the subject is
clearly visioned in his mind at the outset, but
that it proves in some cases too alluring to his
fancy. His work is not artificial; he is not
fashioning poetic bric-à-brac to adorn his verse;
sincerity is writ large upon it; but his mood is
so compelling that he is carried on by the force
of momentum, and finding, when the impulse is
spent, so much beauty left behind, he has not
the heart to destroy it.</p>

<p>One pardons this over-elaboration in <cite>Ballads
of Lost Haven</cite> because of the likelihood of
coming upon a pungent phrase, like a whiff of
kelp, that shall transform some arid spot to the
<!--076.png-->
blue leagues of sea; and for such a poem as
“The Ships of St. John,” with no superfluous
lines, with a calm, sabbatic beauty, one is wholly
Mr. Carman’s debtor.</p>

<p><cite>Behind the Arras</cite> has proven a stumbling-block
and rock of offence to some of Mr. Carman’s
readers, because of its recondite character.
They regard it as something esoteric that
only the initiate may grasp, whereas its mysticism
is half whimsical, and requires no superconsciousness
to divine it. Mr. Carman is
founding no cult; it pleases him for the nonce
to mask his thought in symbols, and there are,
alas, minds of the rectangular sort that have no
use for symbols! It is a book containing many
strong poems, such as “Beyond the Gamut,”
“Exit Anima,” and “Hack and Hew,”&mdash;a book
of spiritual enigmas through which one catches
hints of the open secret, ever-alluring, ever-eluding,
and follows new clews to the mystery,
immanent, yet undivined.</p>

<p>This is the vision that shall lighten our eyes,
quicken our ears, and restore our hope,&mdash;the
vision which we expect the poet to see and to
communicate. He must make the detached
and fragmentary beauty a typical revelation;
the relative must foreshadow the absolute, as
the moon’s arc reveals by its mystic rim the
fulness to which it is orbing. It is not by disregarding
the tragic, the sombre, the inexplicable,
that Mr. Carman comes into his vision.
Pain has more than touched him; it has become
incorporate in him. <cite>Low Tide on Grand Pré</cite>
has its poignant note; <cite>Ballads of Lost Haven</cite>,
its undertone; <cite>Behind the Arras</cite>, its overtone,
its sublimation.</p>

<!--078.png-->
<p>Mr. Carman’s work is more subjective than
that of many of the younger poets without
being less objective, as the Vagabondia books
attest. In one mood he is the mystic, dwelling
in a speculative nebula of thought, in another
the realist concerning himself only with the
demonstrable, and hence his work discloses a
wide range of affinities. He is not a strongly
constructive thinker, but intuitional in his
mental processes, and his verse demands that
gift in his readers. Without it what could one
make of “The Juggler” but a poem of delicious
color and music? If its import were none other
than appears upon the face of it, it would still
be admirable, but as a symbol of the Force
projecting us, it is a subtle bit of art.</p>

<p>Mr. Carman’s sensitiveness to values of
rhythm keeps his verse free from lapses in
that direction. He never, to my memory,
makes use of the sonnet, which shows critical
judgment, as the lyric is his temperamental
medium. The apogee of his art is in his diction,
which has a predestined fitness, and above
all a personal quality. To quote Pater again,
he has “begotten a vocabulary faithful to the
coloring of his own spirit,” and one cannot
mistake even a fragment of his verse. Now
and again one comes upon an archaic expression,
<!--079.png-->
as “A <em>weird</em> is in their song,” using the
ancient noun-form, or upon such a meaningless
solecism, at least to the uninitiate, as
“illumining this <em>quench</em> of clay,” but in general
Mr. Carman does not find it necessary to go
outside the established limits of the language
for variety and force in diction. He has a
genius for imagery, and conjures the most
unsullied fancies from every aspect of nature.
The Vagabondia books are abrim with them,
and while there are idle lines and padded
stanzas, there are few of the poems that do not
strike true flashes here and there, few that
miss of justification, while their gay and rollicking
note heartens one and bids him up
and join in the revel.</p>

<p>There are others in a graver key, such as
Hovey’s “At the End of the Day,” and Carman’s
“The Mendicants,” and “The Marching Morrows;”
and certain lyric inspirations, such as
the “Sea Gypsy,” by Hovey, and the “Vagabond
Song,” by Carman, that have not been bettered
by either, that could not well be bettered within
their limits. The former has been quoted in
the study of Hovey; the latter is equally an inspiration.
Within the confines of two stanzas
Mr. Carman has suggested what volumes of
nature-verse could never say. He does not
<!--080.png-->
analyze it to a finish, nor let the magic slip
through his fingers; under his touch it subtilizes
into atmosphere and thus communicates
the incommunicable:</p>

<p>Throwing aside all that is ephemeral in the
Vagabondia books, all mere boyish ebullition,
there is a goodly residuum of nature-poetry of
the freshest and most unhackneyed sort. It
is the blithe, objective type; eyes and ears are
its informers, and it enters into one’s mood
with a keen sense of refreshment. Who does
not know the impulse that prompted these
lines?</p>

<p>The temper of the Vagabondia books is
thoroughly wholesome; courage and cheer
dominate them; in short, they are good to
know; and while it is not vitally necessary to
remember all they contain, one would be distinctly
the loser should he forget such poems
as “Non Omnis Moriar” or “The Deserted
Inn” from <cite>The Last Songs</cite>.</p>

<p>The collection of Memorabilia, <cite>By the Aurelian
Wall</cite>, takes its title from the burial-place
of Keats, and includes “A Seamark,” the fine
threnody on Stevenson; a thrilling eulogy of
Phillips Brooks; a spiritual, poetic visioning
of Shelley under the symbol of “The White
Gull;” a Bohemian lyric to Paul Verlaine, and
other things equally well-wrought. Some of
them need distilling; the poem to Shelley, in
particular, volatilizes to the vanishing-point&mdash;but
what haunting sweetness it carries with it!
To be sure, Shelley is elusive, and Matthew
Arnold’s “beautiful but ineffectual angel, beating
<!--082.png-->
in the void his luminous wings in vain,”
has come to dominate the popular fancy in
regard to him. Mr. Carman’s poem, though
touched with this mood, is not set to it, and he
has several stanzas which have in them the
essence of Shelley’s spirit,&mdash;the real Shelley,
the passionate idealist, the spent runner who,
falling, handed on the torch.</p>

<p>The Stevenson threnody is probably the
best of the elegies, as Mr. Carman is by temperament
one of the Stevenson brotherhood,
and no subject could better command him.
That “intimate and magic name,” a password
to fellowship, conjures many a picture of him&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. Carman’s three volumes in the projected
“Pipes of Pan” series, including thus far <cite>The

of his talent, and the title poem
“Pipes of Pan,” is a bit of anointed vision
that would waken the dullest eyes from lethargy
as to the world around them. There is
necromancy in Mr. Carman’s words when the
outer world is his theme; something of the
thrill, the expectancy in the heart of growing
things, the elation of life, comes upon one as he
reads the “Pipes of Pan.” It is a nobler vision
than illumined Vagabondia days, revealing</p>

<p>as well as the sheer delight that we noted in
Vagabondia.</p>

<p>It seems that every mood of every creature
has been divined and uttered, uttered with deep

barriers between life and life, whether in man
or in</p>

<p>This relatedness, and all the molding influences
of nature leading us on from beauty to strength,
are developed in Mr. Carman’s poem until they
become to us religion. We realize that at
heart we are all pantheists, and that revelation
antedates the Book; that the law is written on
the leaves of roses as well as on tables of stone,&mdash;a
testament both new and old, given for our
learning that we might have hope.</p>

<p>The remaining poems of <cite>The Book of the
Myths</cite> are not the best things Mr. Carman has
done, though renewals of classic verse-forms
in the Sapphic and other metres, and often
<!--085.png-->
picturesque in story. “The Lost Dryad” is
the most attractive, “The Dead Faun” the
least so, to my ears; but perhaps from lack
of sympathy with the subject-matter I cannot
think the collection, with the exception of the
poem “Pipes of Pan,” is of especial value. It
is not to be named, still excepting the above
poem, with its companion volume, <cite>The Green
Book of the Bards</cite>, which contains some of the
strongest work of Mr. Carman’s pen as to subject
and thought, but which has one pronounced
limitation,&mdash;its monotony of form.</p>

<p>The entire volume, with a sole exception,
and that not marked, is written in the conventional
four-line stanza, in which so much of Mr.
Carman’s work of late has been cast. Within
this compass, the accomplishment is as varied
as to theme and diction, as that of his other
work; but when one sings on and on in the same
numbers, it induces a state of mental indolence
in the reader, and presupposes a similar state
in the writer. The verse goes purling musically
along, until, as running water exercises an
hypnotic spell, one is hypnotized by the mere
melody of the lines, and comes to consciousness
to find that he has no notion what they are
about, and must re-read them to find out. To
be sure, the poems will bear reviewing, and
<!--086.png-->
will make new disclosures whenever one returns
to them; but had they greater variety as to
manner, their appeal would be stronger, as the
mind would be startled to perception by unexpectedness,
instead of lulled by the same note
in liquid reiterance. It is quite possible that
Mr. Carman has a principle at stake in this,&mdash;it
may indeed be a reactionary measure against
over-evident mechanism, a wholesome desire
for simplicity. Now simplicity is one of the
first canons of art, but variety in metre
and form is another canon by no means annulling
the first. One may have variety to
the superlative degree, and never depart from
the fitness and clearness that spell simplicity.</p>

<p>Were <cite>The Green Book of the Bards</cite> relieved
by contrasts of form, it would rank with the
finest work of Mr. Carman’s pen, as the individual
poems have strong basic ideas,&mdash;such
as the “Creature Catechism,” full of pregnant
thought, and speaking a vital, spiritual word
as to the mystic union of the creative Soul with
the creatures of feather and fin and fleece.
The marked evolution of Mr. Carman’s philosophy
of life, as influenced by his growing
identity with nature, comes out so strongly in
the “Pipes of Pan” series, and in <cite>The Word at
Saint Kavin’s</cite>, as almost to reveal a new individuality.

He had gone out in the light-foot,
light-heart days of Vagabondia, holidaying with
the woods and winds; glad to be quit of the
gyves, to drink from the wayside spring, eat
of the forest fruit, sleep ’neath the tent of
night, and dream to the rune of the pines. He
had sought nature in a mood of pagan joy; but
the wayside spring had excited a thirst it could
not quench, and the forest fruit a hunger it
could not allay, and the blithe seeker of freedom
and delight became at length the anointed
votary, and lingered to watch the God at work
shaping life from death, and expressing His
yearning in beauty.</p>

<p>The mere objective delight of the earlier
time has grown steadily into the subjective
identity with every manifestation of the Force
that operates within this world of wonder and
beauty, from the soul of man, shaping his ideals
and creating his environment, to the butterfly
whose sun-painted wings, set afloat in the
buoyant air, are upheld by the breath of God.
Coming into the finer knowledge, through long
intimacy with the earth and its multitudinous
life, fulfilling itself in joy,&mdash;Mr. Carman has

<p>Altogether the Word is admirably expounded
by Saint Kavin, and one is distinctly the gainer
for having rested at his door to learn not only
the grace of joyousness, but the means to that
grace.</p>

<p>In his latest work, constructing from the
“fragments” of Sappho lyrics that should
bear as close relation to the original as an imagination
imbued with the Sapphic traditions
and a temperament sympathetically Greek
would enable him to do,&mdash;Mr. Carman undertook
a daring task, but one whose promise he
<!--092.png-->
has made good, as poetry, however near it may
approach to the imagined loveliness of those lost
songs of the Lesbian, which have served by
their haunting beauty to keep vital her memory
through twenty-five centuries in which unnumbered
names have gone to oblivion.</p>

<p>Of the “Ode to Aphrodite,” the most complete
Sapphic poem extant, many translations and
paraphrases have been made, those by Edwin
Arnold, John Addington Symonds, Ambrose
Philips, Swinburne, etc., being among the
finest; and were there space it would be interesting
to show by comparison that Mr. Carman’s
rendering of the Ode ranks well with the
standard already set.</p>

<p>Of the fragments, also, while perhaps no
previous attempt has been made to give an
imaginative recast to so large a number of
them, many have been incorporated by Swinburne
in his “Anactoria,” and fugitive stanzas
in the work of Rossetti, Tennyson, Byron, and
others, attest this source. To refashion them,
however, after the manner, as Mr. Roberts says
in his introduction to the volume, of a sculptor
restoring a statue by Praxiteles from the mere
suggestion of a hand or a finger,&mdash;is a work of
artistic imagination demanding the finest sympathy,
taste, and kinship with the theme, as
<!--093.png-->
well as the poet’s touch to shape it; and while
no one may pronounce upon the fidelity of the
work, beyond its Greek spirit and command of
the Sapphic metres, together with the interpretation
of the original fragment, it has great
charm of phrase and atmosphere and a certain
pensive beauty even in the most impassioned
stanzas, setting them to a different note from
that usually met in Sapphic paraphrases; as
in these lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">O heart of insatiable longing,</div>
  <div class="verse">What spell, what enchantment allures thee,</div>
  <div class="verse">Over the rim of the world</div>
  <div class="verse">With the sails of the sea-going ships?</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">And when the rose petals are scattered</div>
  <div class="verse">At dead of still noon on the grass-plot,</div>
  <div class="verse">What means this passionate grief,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">This infinite ache of regret?<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>
</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>Among the most familiar of the fragments is
that of the “apple reddening upon the topmost
bough,” which Rossetti has put into
charming phrase, together with its companion
verse upon the wild hyacinth; but while these
lines are of haunting charm, they do not make
a complete stanza, the comparison being unknown;
<!--094.png-->
whereas Mr. Carman, in recasting the
fragment, has supplied a logical complement
to the lines and symmetrized them, together
with their companion illustration, to a lyric.
His rendering, too, while less musical, from
being unrhymed, is picturesque and concise,
each word being made to tell as a stroke in a
sketch:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Art thou the topmost apple</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">The gatherers could not reach,</div>
  <div class="verse">Reddening on the bough?</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Shall not I take thee?</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Art thou a hyacinth blossom</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">The shepherds upon the hills</div>
  <div class="verse">Have trodden into the ground?</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Shall not I lift thee?</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>The first Rossetti stanza ends with a fantastic
play upon words explaining that, although the
gatherers did not get the coveted apple, they</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Forgot it not, nay, but got it not, for none could get it till now,</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>which, although a pleasant poetical mix-up, is
hardly in keeping with the dignity of the comparison,
which dignity Mr. Carman has well
preserved.</p>

<p>Another fragment made familiar by adaptation
is that to Hesperus, expanded by Byron
<!--095.png-->
into one of the great passages of “Don Juan.”
Mr. Carman gives a more compact rendering
and again brings the lines to such a close
as shall render them a complete lyric. They
scarcely vie in beauty with the Byron passage,
which is one of the surest strokes of his hand,
but have their own charm and grace:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Hesperus, bringing together</div>
  <div class="verse">All that the morning star scattered,&mdash;</div>

  <div class="verse">Sheep to be folded in twilight,</div>
  <div class="verse">Children for mothers to fondle,&mdash;</div>

  <div class="verse">Me, too, will bring to the dearest,</div>
  <div class="verse">Tenderest breast in all Lesbos.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>The fragment, “I loved thee, Athis, in the
long ago,” has been expanded by Mr. Carman
into a poem of reminiscent mood, the long,
slow-moving pentameter enhancing the effect
of pensive meditation which the lines convey.
Many of the fragments are of a blither note,
having the variety which distinguishes the
original.</p>

<p>Mr. Carman has exercised a fine restraint
in his treatment of the fragments. They are
not over-ripe in diction, nor over-elaborated,
and while there is a certain atmosphere of
insubstantiality about many of them, as could
<!--096.png-->
scarcely fail to result from the attempt to
restore, by imagination alone, what had existence
but in tradition, they justify themselves
as artistic poetry, which is the only consideration
of moment.</p>

<h4>LOUISE IMOGEN GUINEY</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">SOME critic has said of Miss Guiney’s
work, that to come suddenly upon it
among other volumes of modern poetry
is like coming upon a Greek temple in an
American woodland; and the comparison is an
apt one, though the temple should scarcely be
Greek, for while the feeling and structure of
the work are classic in atmosphere, they are
not warm enough, sensuous enough, to be
Greek. It would, indeed, be hard to say with
what race classicism Miss Guiney’s work is
tinctured. Rather say that she is a classic by
temperament and has drawn to herself, as by
chemical affinity, such things as are rare and
choice in the world of books and life, and has
fused them in the alembic of her own nature,
until the resultant blend is something new and
strange, having a racy tang and a flavor all its
own, and yet with a hint of all the elements
that went to its compounding.</p>

<p>Most minds take on learning by a miscellaneous
accretion that results in information
<!--098.png-->
without individuality, but Miss Guiney hives
in many fields and lands the quaint, the picturesque,
the beautiful, to which her temperament
calls her unerringly, and can no more be
tempted to range outside her limit of attraction
than a bee to waste his precious hours dipping
into bloom that holds no nectar for him. To
be sure, Miss Guiney’s range of attraction is
wide, but it enlarges its own confines, and does
not reach out to alien territory. It follows
as a corollary to this fact that unless one be
in the range of attraction with Miss Guiney,
the subjects which claim her thought may be
more or less alien to him, and the restrained,
wholly individual manner of her work may be
equally alien to his nature. He may require
more warmth, more abandon, more of the element
of to-day and to-morrow in the theme and
mood; for Miss Guiney has little to do with
the times and conditions in which she finds
herself; contemporary life is only incidentally
in her verse, and one would have difficulty from
it in declaring her day and generation. Her
poetry demands that synchronism of temperament
by which one responds to her mood
independent of the time or place to which it
transports him.</p>

<p>The rhyme scheme in this poem has a distinct
fascination to the ear; there is music in
the lucid words and in the rhythmic lines,
climaxing in each stanza, and, moreover, every
stanza is a picture, with a concrete relation to
the whole. The poem illustrates several of
Miss Guiney’s characteristics: first, the compactness
of her verse. It is never pirouetting
merely to show its grace; in other words, she
does not let the unity of the idea escape in a
profusion of imagery. She uses figure and
symbol with an individual freshness of conception,
but always that which is structural with
the thought, so that one can rarely detach a
stanza or even fugitive lines of her poems without
a loss of value. She develops the theme
without over-developing it, which is the restraint
of the artist. The above poem illustrates, also,
the white light which she throws upon her
<!--103.png-->
words when clarity and simplicity are demanded
by the form; whereas, in sonnets, in her dramatic
poem, “A Martyr’s Idyl,” and in other forms
of verse, her work is sometimes lacking in
that clear, swiftly communicative quality which
poetry should possess; but in her lyric inspirations,
where the form and melody condition the
diction, one may note the perfect clarity and
flexibility which she attains, without loss of the
rare and picturesque word-feeling that belongs
so inseparably to her.</p>

<p>The stanzas to “Athassal Abbey,” the “Footnote
To A Famous Lyric,” the delicate “Lilac
Song,” and many others blend the finer qualities
of word and metre. With the exception of the
last poem, however, they have not the emotional
warmth that imbues several other of her
lyrics, as the two “Irish Peasant Songs,” which
are inspirations of sheer beauty, especially the
first, in its subtlety of race-temperament and
personal mood, left unanalyzed,&mdash;for a further
hint would destroy it,&mdash;but holding spring
and tears and youth in its wistful word and
measure:</p>

<p>The out-of-door atmosphere which Miss
Guiney has managed to infuse into these lines is
fairly palpable. What sense of moisture in the
dew-heavy air is in the second stanza, and what
elation and buoyancy of returning life vitalizes
the first! While on this phase of her work
there is another poem as magnetically charged,
and full of ozone, but its objective side incidental
to a subjective query which nature and
science force to the lips:</p>

the fantastic; for one need only have it glimpsed
before him to know that he has seen the same

the world without, as if no eyes but hers had
looked upon it; she brings no other image
upon the lens of her vision, and hence the
imprint is as newly mirrored, and as fresh
with each changing view as a moving reflection

<p>articulates the cry which life wrings at sometime
from each of us, noting the infinite solicitude
<!--107.png-->
that writes self-executing laws in the hearts of
the creatures, while man goes blundering after
intimations and dreams. One comes at times
face to face with the necessity to justify the
ways of God to man, when he notes throughout
nature the unerring certainty of instinct,
and the stumbling fallibility of reason. He
questions why the bee excels him in wisdom and
force and persistence, in shaping conditions for
its maintenance, and in intuitions of destiny;
or why the infinite exactness that established
the goings of the ant in the devious ways of
her endeavor should have left man to follow
so fatuous a gleam as human intuition in finding
his own foot-path among the tortuous ways of
life. And these queries Miss Guiney’s poem
raises, though not with arraignment, rather
with the logical demand:</p>

<p>“The Kings” and “The Perfect Hour” are
other trumpet notes of Miss Guiney’s, illustrating
the individuality of her point of view and
the personality of her expression.</p>

<p>A poet’s words may be wind-blown feathers,
or they may be flint-tipped arrows singing to a
mark. The defect with much of present-day
poetry is that it is not aimed, it is content to
be a pretty flight of feathers, blown by the
breath of fancy, and reaching no vital spot.</p>

<p>To test Miss Guiney’s marksmanship with
words, one may separate her at once from the
class who are flying airy illusions nowhither,
for she concentrates, instead of diffusing, and
<!--111.png-->
has, at the outset, a definite point in view. She
works upon the arrow principle, but now and
again glances from the mark. In such a poem
as “The Recruit,” in “The Wild Ride,” or the
“Saint George” quoted from, in her stirring
poem “Sanctuary,” beginning,</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="verse">O storms! farewell,</div>

</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>and in many others, she cleaves straight to her
aim with no deflection. The same may be
said of many of her lighter poems, the charming
“Lilac Song,” or this delicately wrought
love-song, speeding to the heart:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">When on the marge of evening the last blue light is broken,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And winds of dreamy odor are loosened from afar;</div>

 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">I think of thee (O mine the more if other eyes be sleeping!)</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Whose great and noonday splendor the many share and see,</div>
  <div class="verse">While, sacred and forever, some perfect law is keeping</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">The late and early twilight alone and sweet for me.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>In poems of this kind and in deeper ones
from the spiritual side of her nature, as well as
in those of valor and daring, she uses such
words as are tipped with a penetrative point;
but in some of her sonnets, such as “The
<!--112.png-->
Chantry,” in a narrative poem, such as “The
Vigil in Tyrone,” though not without picturesque
quality, in “The Squall,” despite its frequently
fine imagery, and often in the dramatic
poem, “A Martyr’s Idyl,” the words are too
much weighted to carry to the mark; they
suggest undue care in selection which interposes
between the motive of the poem and the
sympathy of the reader. One pauses to consider
the words; and the initial impulse, like a
spent shell, falls at his feet. Miss Guiney’s
diction is, in the main, peculiarly crisp and apposite;
but she does not always hold to the
directness of appeal that distinguishes her
truest work, but withdraws herself into subtleties,
often beautiful, but too remote. “A Martyr’s Idyl”
is a dramatically conceived incident,
well wrought as to scene and character, and
having many passages of great beauty; but the
effort to keep the expression to the manner of
the time results in a lack of flexibility in the
style that is now and then cumbrous. On the
whole, it is not in a dramatic poem of this sort
that Miss Guiney best reveals herself, but in
such inspirations as she has taken&mdash;</p>

<p>The term “original” is one to be used
charily and with forethought, but it is one
that belongs without danger of challenge to
Miss Guiney’s work. There is a distinct quality,
both of treatment and conception, that is
hers alone, a rare, unfamiliar note, without
reminiscent echoes. While it has a certain
classic quaintness, it has also vitality and concrete
forcefulness.</p>

<p>Her metrical command is varied, and she
employs many forms with assurance of touch.
She has a group of Alexandrian songs in <cite>A
Roadside Harp</cite>, most of them with beauty of
measure and atmosphere. Here, in three lines,
is a rhythmic achievement:</p>

<!--114.png-->

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Me, deep-tresséd meadows, take to your loyal keeping,</div>
  <div class="verse">Hard by the swish of sickles ever in Aulon sleeping,</div>
  <div class="verse">Philophron, old and tired, and glad to be done with reaping!</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>How the “swish of sickles” conveys their very
sound! This ability to put into certain words
both the music and the picture distinguishes
Miss Guiney. In her sonnet upon the “Pre-Reformation
Churches about Oxford,” even
the names that would seem to suggest an inartistic
enumeration are made to convey the
sense of sabbatical sweetness and calm and to
visualize the scene.</p>

<p><cite>The Sonnets Written at Oxford</cite> mark, as a
whole, her finest work in this form, although
the twelve London sonnets are full of strong
lines and images, and several of them, such as
“Doves” and “In The Docks,” take swift hold
upon one’s sympathy. The former flashes a
picture at the close, by way of rebuke to the
over-solicitous mood, which is not only charming
from the artistic side, but opens the eyes
in sudden content and gladness.</p>

<p>To sum up Miss Guiney’s work, as well as
one may, in a sentence,&mdash;it has no flaccid
thought. There is fibre in all she writes; fibre
and nerve. Were the fervor and passion which
she throws into her songs of valor to be diffused
throughout her verse, making its appeal more
intimate and personal, she would speak more
widely, but scarcely to more appreciative readers
than now delight in her individuality.</p>

that of beauty; his time that of the gods; his
faith the sanctity of loveliness; and his creed

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that were Mr.
Santayana in a cloister, or upon a mid-sea
island with his books and dreams, he could
scarcely be less in touch with the passing world
than he is in the midst of the clamor and
insistence of modern life, where he keeps the
tranquillity of the inner silence as if there were
no voices dinning in his ears. He is subjective
to the degree of transfusing himself with another’s
consciousness, and looking upon his
own nature from an impersonal standpoint:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">There we live o’er, amid angelic powers,</div>
  <div class="verse">Our lives without remorse, as if not ours,</div>
  <div class="verse">And others’ lives with love, as if our own,&mdash;</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>says one of the sonnets, imaging the passion-stilled
world of reflection.</p>

<p>There is a subtlety in Mr. Santayana’s
processes of thought that demands intuitive
divination on the part of the reader; there is
so little objectivity to the idea that its essence
may almost escape him. His illustrative symbolism
is almost never drawn from nature or
the world of men and events, but from the
treasure of beauty at the depth of his spirit,
<!--121.png-->
where, by some mystic chemistry, he has separated
all the elements not in harmony with
him. There must at some time have been
reaction and repulsion, ferment and explosion,
in the laboratory of Mr. Santayana’s mind;
but he awaited the subsidence of the action;
awaited the period when emotion, thought, and
learning had distilled and crystallized before
he shaped them forth before the world.</p>

<p>This gives to his work a certain fixity both
of mood and form; his thoughts are as gems
that flash without heat, not the ruby-hearted,
passion-dyed gems, but the pale topaz or the
amber, holding the imprisoned glow of reflection.
If this may seem to limit Mr. Santayana’s
achievement, it is not so intended, but rather
to reveal his distinction. He is not only a
true poet, but one of rare accomplishment; his
work, however, is for those who are deeply
subjective, who trance themselves with the
beautiful as an anodyne for pain; those who
subordinate to-day to the storied charm of
yesterday, and look backward to the twilight
of the gods, rather than forward to the renewing
sunrise. It is not for those whose creed of
poetry is that it should be all things to all
men; that life, in travail to deliver truth, should
utter its cries through the poet. It is for those
<!--122.png-->
who know that poetry can no more be adapted
to all than could the spoken words of a great
teacher reach equally the diverse minds of a
multitude whom he might address; and that
while it may be the office of one poet to interpret
the struggles, the activities, the aims of
life, it may be equally the part of another to
penetrate to that calm at the depth of the
soul where throes have brought forth peace.
Not only are there various natures to whom
poetry speaks, but natures within natures, so
that all poets speak to different phases of our
consciousness: some to the mind,&mdash;and here
the range is infinite,&mdash;some to the heart,
and some to the soul, and of the last is Mr.
Santayana. He is for the meditative hours
when we are sounding the depths of ourselves
and come back to the surface of things,
bringing with us the unsatisfied pain of being.
Hours when we turn instinctively to a sonnet
like this to find our mood expressed:</p>

<p>The much-mooted, but vaguely understood,
sub-conscious mind, speaks in this sonnet in
terms of the conscious. It is a subtle bit of
philosophy, but not more so than several others
in the same sequence which show the evolution
of Mr. Santayana’s attitude toward life.
One may not in a brief space follow out the
clews to this development, whose beginning
was in religious emotion:</p>

<p>which every life duplicates as it leaves its well-guarded
walls of belief and ventures out upon
undiscovered ways. The pain of letting go the
old, the loneliness of the new, the alien look of
all the heights that encompass one, and the
psychology of that impulse by which one is
both impelled to retrace his way and withheld
from it,&mdash;are suggested by the sonnet. In
the next occurs one of Mr. Santayana’s finest
lines, the counsel</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">To trust the soul’s invincible surmise.</div>

<p>It would be difficult to define intuition more
succinctly than this. It is not, as less subtle
poets would have put it, the soul’s assurance
that one is to trust; this would be to assume,
for what assurance have we but that which Mr.
Santayana has so subtly termed the “invincible
surmise”?</p>

<p>Lines which lead one out into speculative
thought are frequent in Mr. Santayana’s sonnets.
His philosophy is constructive only in
so far as it unifies a succession of moods and
experiences; but it is pregnant with suggestion
<!--125.png-->
to a psychological mind. One of the sonnets
which questions:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Of my two lives, which should I call the dream?</div>
  <div class="verse">Which action vanity? which vision sight?&mdash;</div>

<p>and blend the two visions to one seeing,
continues:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Even such a dream I dream, and know full well</div>
  <div class="verse">My waking passeth like a midnight spell,</div>
  <div class="verse">But know not if my dreaming breaketh through</div>
  <div class="verse">Into the deeps of heaven and of hell.</div>

 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The thought in this passage is elusive, but it
is more than a play upon words. It is another
way of putting the question, which shall be
trusted, which shall become the reality, the
objective or the subjective world? One knows
that his “waking,” his sense perception, is transitory,
that it apprehends but the present, which
“passeth like a midnight spell,” but how far
does the other and finer sight penetrate</p>

<!--126.png-->
<p>In simpler phrase, unless the vision and conviction
are to be trusted, unless, to revert to Mr.
Santayana’s former words, the soul’s “invincible
surmise” be taken as truth, that which we know
as truth is but a phantasm.</p>

<p>The sonnet sequence is the intimate record
of an individual soul in its evolving spiritual
life, and has the significance belonging only to
art which interprets a personality, an experience,
in whose development one finds some
clew to his own labyrinth. It reveals the many
phases of speculation, reflection, questioning,
through which one passes in the transition
from beliefs indoctrinated in the mind at its
earliest consciousness, to convictions which
follow thought liberated by life, by intimacy
with nature, and by recognition of its own
spiritual authority. It is the winning of this
conviction, with its attendant seeking and unrest,
allayed by draughts from the wayside
springs of beauty, memory, and imagination,&mdash;which
comprises the record of the first
sonnet sequence, whose conclusions, as “strewn
thoughts” springing along the way, are gathered
into a final chaplet for the brows of the
“Eternal Mother,” Nature, whose peace he
sought when he came down from Golgotha,
and whose larger meaning, synonymous with
<!--127.png-->
the primal freedom of the soul, is conveyed
in the sonnet:</p>

  <div class="verse">And to mine opened eyes thy secrets give,</div>

  <div class="verse">And in thine immortality be young.</div>

  <div class="verse">That hath her life’s rich sources otherwhere;</div>
  <div class="verse">She is a parcel of the sacred air.</div>
  <div class="verse">She takes her being from the breath of Spring,</div>

</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Aside from Mr. Santayana’s philosophical
sonnets he has a second sequence, upon love,
which, too, is philosophically tinged. In the
matter of beauty this is perhaps the more finished
and artistic work; but I have chosen rather
to dwell upon the subtlety of his speculations
in those phases of thought less universally
treated of by poets than is love. It has not
been possible, however, to follow the sequence
in its order, or to present more than certain
individual notes of its philosophy.</p>

<p>Thus far it has been the matter, rather than
the manner, of Mr. Santayana’s verse that has
been considered; but before glancing at the
<!--128.png-->
later sonnet sequence, what of his touch upon
the strings of his instrument? One can scarcely
have followed the extracts quoted without noting
the mellow suavity, the ease, the poise of
his work. There is everywhere assurance of
expression, nothing tentative, nothing halting.
His lines are disposed by the laws of counter-point
into well-ordered cadences where nothing
jars; his words are rich and mellifluous, in short,
he has, as a sonneteer, a finish, a classical command
of the vehicle reminiscent of Petrarch and
Camoens. The sonnet is, by the nature of the
case, a somewhat inadaptable instrument, and
yet it is susceptible of great individuality, as
one may note by recalling an intricate sonnet
by Rossetti and a sweeping, sonorous one by
Milton. The criticism which is, perhaps, most
apposite to Mr. Santayana’s sonnets is that
they are “faultily faultless;” they are so finished
that one would welcome a false note now and
then, that suggested a choke in the voice, or a
heart-beat out of time.</p>

<p>There is an atmosphere about all of Mr.
Santayana’s work that conveys a sense of
wandering in the moonlight; it is tempered,
softened, stilled; it is like an Isis-veil cast over
the eyes; but at times one becomes oppressed
with the consciousness of himself, and of the
<!--129.png-->
impalpable visions glimpsed in the wan light,
and longs to snatch the veil away and flee to the
garish world again. One may seek Mr. Santayana’s
poetry when his mood demands it, and
it will be as a cooling hand in fever; but when
the pulse of being is low, and one needs the
touch to vitalize, he must turn to others, for
Mr. Santayana’s work is not charged with the
electricity that thrills.</p>

<p>Because he is not inventive in metre nor
sufficiently light in touch, Mr. Santayana is not
a lyrist. He has scarcely any purely lyrical
verse in his collections, and what is contained
in them is too lacking in spontaneity to be
classed with his best work. It is not wanting
in lines of beauty and in English undefiled; but
the sense of tone and rhythm, except of the
smoothly conventional sort, is absent. There
are no innovations in form and the impulse is
too subdued for a true lyric. That called “Midnight”
has more warmth than the others.
Several of his odes in the Sapphic metre
have great charm, especially the first. His elegiac
verse has often rare elevation of thought;
but it, also, has too set a measure, too much
of the “formed style” to be vital. It brings
well-conceived, well-imaged thought, as in this
stanza:</p>

<!--130.png-->

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">How should the vision stay to guide the hand,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">How should the holy thought and ardour stay,</div>
  <div class="verse">When the false deeps of all the soul are sand,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And the loose rivets of the spirit, clay?</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>but it rarely shocks one into thinking for himself.</p>

<p>In relation to diction, there are few American
writers who use English of such purity
and finish as does Mr. Santayana; but it
is the scholar’s English, the English drawn
from familiarity with the great masters and
models, and hence lacks the creative flexibility,
the quick, warm, ductile adaptability, that a
much less accomplished poet may give to
his words. It keeps to the accepted canons,
the highest, the purest, and uses the consecrated
words of literature with an artist’s
touch; but the racy idiom, the word which
some daring poet coined yesterday in an exigent
moment&mdash;with these it has naught to do.</p>

<p>Mr. Santayana has several dramatic poems,
“The Hermit of Carmel,” “The Knight’s Return,”
and a dialogue between Hermes and
Lucifer, in which the latter relates the details
of his banishment from heaven for his daring
arraignment and interrogation of God. The
dialogue has little dramatic coloring; one hearing
it read aloud would have difficulty in determining
<!--131.png-->
from the outward change of expression
and personality where Lucifer leaves off
speaking and Hermes begins, but it puts into
the mouth of Lucifer some words full of the
challenge of thought, and speaks through both
some beautiful fantasies, such as this reply of
Lucifer to Hermes’ question as to the state of
bliss in which the angels dwell:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent8">A doubtful thing</div>
  <div class="verse">Is blessedness like that….</div>
  <div class="verse">Their raptured souls, like lilies in a stream</div>
  <div class="verse">That from their fluid pillow never rise,</div>
  <div class="verse">Float on the lazy current of a dream.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Mr. Santayana has not written “The Hermit
of Carmel” or “The Knight’s Return” with a
theatrical manager in view. They are stories
told in verse, tales of gentle melancholy, pleasant
to the ear; but when all is said, one returns to
his sonnets as the true expression of his nature
and the consummation of his gifts. He is a sonneteer,
by every phase of his temperament and
every canon of his art. His work in all other
forms is cultivated, philosophical, finely finished,
but pervaded by an atmosphere of cultured conventionality;
whereas in the sonnet he finds a
medium whose classic distinction and subtlety
are so harmonized to his nature and his characteristic
mode of thought, that it becomes to him
<!--132.png-->
the predestined expression. A glance, then, in
closing, at the flexile phrases, the psychological
analyses of the later sonnet sequence, turning
chiefly upon love.</p>

<p>But, first, let me cite from one of the earlier
sonnets, an image drawn from this theme, a
jewel-like flash of beauty, not to be overlooked.
The first line of the metaphor is commonplace;
but note the succeeding ones:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Love but the formless and eternal Whole</div>
  <div class="verse">From whose effulgence one unheeded ray</div>
  <div class="verse">Breaks on this prism of dissolving clay</div>
  <div class="verse">Into the flickering colors of thy soul.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>This is defining the individual spirit in exquisite
terms.</p>

<p>The second sequence teems with beautiful
passages, now and again with a note of the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">trovatore</i>, as in the sestett of this sonnet:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Yet why, of one who loved thee not, command</div>
  <div class="verse">Thy counterfeit, for other men to see,</div>
  <div class="verse">When God himself did on my heart for me</div>
  <div class="verse">Thy face, like Christ’s upon the napkin, brand?</div>
  <div class="verse">O how much subtler than a painter’s hand</div>
  <div class="verse">Is love to render back the truth of thee!</div>
  <div class="verse">My soul should be thy glass in time to be,</div>
  <div class="verse">And in my thought thine effigy should stand.</div>
  <div class="verse">Yet, lest the churlish critics of that age</div>
  <div class="verse">Should flout my praise, and deem a lover’s rage</div>
<!--133.png-->
  <div class="verse">Could gild a virtue and a grace exceed,</div>
  <div class="verse">I bid thine image here confront my page,</div>
  <div class="verse">That men may look upon thee as they read,</div>
  <div class="verse">And cry: “Such eyes a better poet need!”</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>This has art and charm, but in contrast note
the impassioned nobility of utterance which imbues
the one that follows. Here are lines of
pure emotion and beauty:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">We needs must be divided in the tomb,</div>
  <div class="verse">For I would die among the hills of Spain,</div>
  <div class="verse">And o’er the treeless, melancholy plain</div>
  <div class="verse">Await the coming of the final gloom.</div>
  <div class="verse">But thou&mdash;O pitiful!&mdash;wilt find scant room</div>
  <div class="verse">Among thy kindred by the northern main,</div>
  <div class="verse">And fade into the drifting mist again,</div>
  <div class="verse">The hemlocks’ shadow, or the pines’ perfume.</div>
  <div class="verse">Let gallants lie beside their ladies’ dust</div>
  <div class="verse">In one cold grave, with mortal love inurned;</div>
  <div class="verse">Let the sea part our ashes, if it must,</div>
  <div class="verse">The souls fled thence which love immortal burned,</div>
  <div class="verse">For they were wedded without bond of lust,</div>
  <div class="verse">And nothing of our heart to earth returned.</div>

<p>Such sonnets as this mark Mr. Santayana
as a master of this form, and while his other
work has value, it is as a sonneteer that he
has made his really individual contribution to
literature.</p>

<h4>JOSEPHINE PRESTON PEABODY</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">A BEAUTIFUL and delicate art is that
of Miss Josephine Preston Peabody,
but somewhat elusive of analysis, so
much is its finer part dependent upon the intuition
which one brings to it; for Miss Peabody
is a poet-mystic, sensitive to impressions from
which the grosser part has slipped away,&mdash;impressions
which come to her clothed upon with
a more ethereal vesture than the work-a-day
garment of thought,&mdash;and while she would fain
reveal their hidden import, they often elude
her and grow remote in the telling, as if fearful
of betraying too openly their secret.</p>

<p>Her first volume, <cite>The Wayfarers</cite>, revealed
at the outset a poet’s imagination, and a technique
so finished that it had already the touch
of the artist, but its vision was that of the novice
who looks at the morning from beneath her
white veil and wonders at the world of sin and
strife and passion whose pain has never reached
her. It was the work of one who had not yet
<!--135.png-->
met her revealing crisis, not yet been identified
to herself, of one reaching out after truth with
the filament of fancy until the ductile thread
had often been spun too far before it found
anchorage. The volume was, in short, an exquisite
conjecture as to life, whose baffling,
alluring mystery only now and again flashed
upon her an unveiled glance of its eyes. This
is not, however, to say that the conjecture was
vain; indeed, the initial poem, “The Wayfarers,”
in which, perhaps, it was most definitely embodied,
is a thoughtful, suggestive song holding
many truths worth pondering, and in phrasing
and technique wrought with so much grace
that it might stand beside any work of the later
volumes. Indeed, this statement is apposite to
nearly all the work in the first collection, which
in that regard presents an unusual distinction,
having from the first on its technical side a
maturity that seemed not to belong to the tentative
work of a young poet; it was, however,
over-ornate, lacking directness and simplicity,
and inclining to excess of elaboration in theme,
so that one often became entangled in the weft
of poetic artifice and lost the clew of thought.
Take as a random illustration the following
stanzas from the poem entitled “The Weavers,”
under which Miss Peabody symbolizes the elusive
<!--136.png-->
hopes and fancies that come by night,
weaving their weft of dreams:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Lo, a gray pallor on the loom</div>
  <div class="verse">Waxeth apace,&mdash;a glamourie</div>
  <div class="verse">Like dawn outlooking, pale to see</div>
  <div class="verse">Before the sun hath burst to bloom;</div>
  <div class="verse">Wan beauty, growing out of gloom,</div>
  <div class="verse">With promise of fair things to be.</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">&middot;&emsp;&emsp;&middot;&emsp;&emsp;&middot;&emsp;&emsp;&middot;&emsp;&emsp;&middot;</div>

  <div class="verse">The shuttle singeth. And fair things</div>
  <div class="verse">Upon the web do come and go;</div>
  <div class="verse">Dim traceries like clouds ablow</div>
  <div class="verse">Fade into cobweb glimmerings,</div>
  <div class="verse">A silver, fretted with small wings,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">The while a voice is singing low.</div>

</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>Of the eight remaining stanzas several are
equally lacking in anything that may be
grasped, and while there is a certain art in
imaging the elusive fancies which the weavers
bring, there should be some more definite
fancy or ideal to embody, rather than the
mere intent to make beautiful lines. This
is, perhaps, an extreme instance of the over-elaboration
of the first volume, though it distinguishes
the long poem which gives its name
to the collection, and appears in many of the
lyrics.</p>

<p>Altogether, Miss Peabody’s first book of
verse revealed strength, feeling, and imagination,
though tentative in its philosophy, as
the initial work of a young poet must necessarily
be, and having but a slight rooting
in life.</p>

<p>The second volume, <cite>Fortune and Men’s
Eyes</cite>, opens with a cleverly written one-act
play, turning upon an adventure of two maids
of honor at Elizabeth’s court, with Master W.
S., a player, whose identity is not far to seek,
and William Herbert, son of the Earl of Pembroke,
the scene being laid at the tavern of the
Bear and the Angel, whither Mistress Anne
Hughes and Mary Fyton have resorted on a
merry escapade under cover of seeing the
people celebrate the fête of the Bear.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the time is well reproduced,
the dialogue of the tapsters cleverly
<!--142.png-->
done, and the final scene between the Player
and Mary is full of dramatic intensity.</p>

<p>In her second volume, Miss Peabody has
also a dramatic monologue called, “The
Wingless Joy,” which, though now and
again Browningesque in tone, has many felicitous
images and shows a true insight into
human motive.</p>

<p>The lyrics in the second volume form a less
important part of the collection, though there
are several, such as “The Source,” “The Survivor,”
“Psyche in the Niche,” and “In the
Silence,” which rank with Miss Peabody’s
best work, particularly the last, illustrating
the truth that the Spirit manifests at the
need, even the dumb and undivining need,
and not alone at the call:</p>

<p>It is a human bit of dramatic analysis, and
reduces inconsistent femininity to a common
denominator.</p>

<p>In her third volume, <cite>Marlowe</cite>, a drama,
founded upon the life of the lovable but erratic
poet and playwright, Miss Peabody essayed an
ambitious undertaking, but one which, as literature,
carries its full justification. As drama,
one must qualify. In characterization, aside
from Marlowe himself, who comes before one
vividly, there is a lack of sharp definition.
Nashe, Lodge, Peele, and Green, Marlowe’s fellow
playwrights and friends, might, from the
evidence of the dialogue, be the same character
under different names, so alike are they in
speech and temperament. Next to Marlowe
himself, Bame, who through jealousy becomes
his enemy, and brings on the final tragedy, is
the most individually drawn. Of the women
characters, the drama presents practically but
one,&mdash;Alison, the little country maid who loves
Marlowe secretly, and becomes in a way his
good angel,&mdash;as “Her Ladyship” of the Court,
object of his adoration, is introduced but twice
in the play, and that veiled, so that only for a
moment at the last may one see the beauty
that&mdash;under guise of Helen&mdash;inspired Marlowe’s
lines:</p>

<!--146.png-->

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Was this the face that launched a thousand ships</div>
  <div class="verse">And burned the topless towers of Ilium!</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>While the two brief comings of “Her Ladyship”
impart an artistic touch of mystery, it is to
be doubted if in a play so intangible a heroine
could become a vital factor, and if she were not,
the woman element of the drama must be sustained
wholly by Alison, the little “Quietude,”
who, until the one beautiful scene with Marlowe
after her marriage, remains an artless undeveloped
child, with too little color, too weak a
human pulse-beat, to compel interest and
sympathy. She is delicately drawn, in her unsophisticated
sweetness and purity, and the
inner strength of her nature is finely shown at
the last, but up to this period of revelation one
does not feel her; she lacks the touch of life
essential to a character in drama.</p>

<p>In plot the work presents somewhat the same
limitation. It is, until the two final scenes,
after Marlowe’s downfall, literature without
action: nothing happens in the earlier part of
the play to create an element of suspense forelooking
to the developments at the close.
Marlowe’s triumphs are detailed to one another
by his friends, but they are not <em>shown</em> in some
great scene where he might receive the acclamations
of the people and so contrast sharply
<!--147.png-->
with his downfall at the end: story suffices for
action. The sentiment of the play presents
also no intricacies: Alison, although loving
Marlowe, is not for a moment a factor of love
in his life, since he neither suspects her attachment
nor reciprocates it, and hence the jealousy
of her suitors has no effect either upon him or
upon the supposed audience. “Her Ladyship”
is not pitted against Alison, since the
latter knows that Marlowe’s heart is given to his
veiled divinity; hence there are no complexities
arising from the love-element. For the purpose
of acting, therefore, the play seems to me
to lack movement, suspense, variety of characterization,
and, except in the drawing of Marlowe,
definiteness of type. It has, however, a
strong and vivid scene at the close, leading
up to and including Marlowe’s tragic death,
and a scene of rare beauty and of intense
dramatic reality, of which I shall speak later,
in the visit of Marlowe to Alison after his
downfall.</p>

<p>On the side of literature, the drama contains
work of admirable strength and quality, work
that in its beauty of phrase and subtlety of
penetration is not unworthy to be put into the
mouth of Marlowe of the “mighty line.” Miss
Peabody never falls into the Shakespearizing
<!--148.png-->
strain which many writing of that epoch assume;
her dialogue is vivid, direct, and full of
original imagery, as when Marlowe speaks of
Alison as having for him&mdash;</p>

  <div class="verse">I took you for a Woman, thing of dust,&mdash;</div>

<p>At once the most beautiful and artistically
drawn scene is that previously referred to, in
which Marlowe, his star in eclipse, visits Alison
after her marriage. Here is a dramatic situation,
human and vital, and Miss Peabody has
developed it with rare feeling and skill. The
picture of Marlowe in his disgrace and despondency,
coming to the woman who had
believed in him, and whose love had shone
upon his unseeing eyes, is drawn with fine
delicacy and pathos. In the flash of revelation
that comes to him from her white spirit,
he speaks these words:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent8">Thou hast heard</div>
  <div class="verse">Of Light that shined in darkness, hast thou not?</div>
  <div class="verse">And darkness comprehended not the Light?</div>

  <div class="verse">So. But I tell thee why. It was because</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">&middot;&emsp;&emsp;&middot;&emsp;&emsp;&middot;&emsp;&emsp;&middot;&emsp;&emsp;&middot;</div>

  <div class="verse">Have pity on the Dark, I tell you, Bride.</div>
  <div class="verse">For after all is said, there is no thing</div>
  <div class="verse">So hails the Light as that same blackness there,</div>
  <div class="verse">O’er which it shines the whiter. Do you think</div>
  <div class="verse">It will not know at last?&mdash;it will not know?</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Those, too, are noble passages, though too
long to quote, in which Marlowe unburdens
his overcharged heart to Alison, and intrusts
to her faith the keeping of that higher self she
had divined in him; and when Marlowe, early
in the scene, referring to his misfortunes, says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent8">You do not know</div>
  <div class="verse">The sense of waking down among the dead,</div>
  <div class="verse">Hard by some lazar-house,&mdash;</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->

<p>note the hidden meaning in Alison’s reply:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent8">Nay; but I know</div>
  <div class="verse">The sense of death. And then to rise again</div>
  <div class="verse">And feel thyself bewildered, like a spirit</div>
  <div class="verse">Out of the grave-clothes and the fragment strewings.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Passages of subtle significance, wistful, tender,
and pathetic, distinguish this scene.</p>

<p>Miss Peabody has visualized Marlowe clearly
wherever he appears, and created him as the
lovable, impulsive, generous-spirited, but ill-starred
<!--151.png-->
genius that he was. It is a life-study,
in its conflicts, its overthrown ideals, its appealing
humanity, and should take its place as
one of the permanent interpretations of his
character.</p>

<p>Many of her critics have found in Miss Peabody’s
latest volume, <cite>The Singing Leaves</cite>, an
inspiration and charm exceeding that of her
former work, and in delicacy, lyrical ease, simplicity,
and ideality it must be accounted one
of her truest achievements; but there is about
the volume an impalpability, an airy insubstantiality,
which renders it elusive and unconvincing.
The mystical subtlety hitherto noted in
Miss Peabody’s work has, in the latest volume,
grown, until many of the poems have so little
objectivity that they float as iris-tinted flecks of
foam upon the deep of thought. They have
beauty of spirit, beauty of word; but their motive
is so subtle, their thought so intangible,
that while they charm one in the reading, they
have, with a few exceptions, melted into vapor,
gone the way of the foam, when once the eye
has left them. One feels throughout the volume
an ingenuous simplicity, a <em>naïveté</em>, that is,
in many of her poems, exceedingly charming,
but which, becoming the pervasive note of the
collection, communicates to it a certain artificial
<!--152.png-->
artlessness, as if June, disregarding the largess
of the rose, yearned back to April and the
violet; in short, the poems seem to me, with a
few exceptions, to lack moving, vital impulse,
and to bring few warmly imbued words from
life. They are as the pale moon-flower, growing
in the stillness of dreams, rather than the
rose dyed with the blood of the heart.</p>

<p>But what is, to me, the limitation of the
volume,&mdash;its over-subtilized mood and lack of
definite, moving purpose,&mdash;must, to many of
its readers, be granted to be its distinction;
and for their very impalpability these delicate
Leaves, that vibrate with impulse as ethereal as
that which moves the aspen when the wind is
still, have for many the greater charm.</p>

<p>To glance, then, at some of the finer achievements
of the volume, one finds among the
lyrics several turning upon love that catch in
artistic words an undefined mood, such as
“Forethought” and “Unsaid,” or in captivating
picture-phrase, a blither fancy, such as
“The Enchanted Sheepfold,” or, stronger
and finer than these, that vision of love called
“The Cloud,” which enfolds truth and wraps
the heart in its whiteness. One can scarcely
fancy a more exquisite bit of imagery in which
to clothe the thought of these lines:</p>

echoes in Miss Peabody’s song, its note, measure,
<!--154.png-->
and spirit are entirely her own, and a random
stanza would carry its identification, so individual
is her touch. Of the seventeenth-century
mood, however, are “The Song Outside,”
“Forethought,” “The Top of the Morning,”
“The Blind One,” and other poems.</p>

<p>Nearly all the lyrics in <cite>The Singing Leaves</cite>
are very brief, showing, in their compactness
and restrained use of imagery, just the opposite
method from that prevailing in Miss Peabody’s
first book, <cite>The Wayfarers</cite>. So marked is the
contrast that, but for the personality imbuing
them, they might have been written by another
hand. Whereas the diction also in the earlier
work inclined to beauty for its own sake, the
reaction to its present simplicity is the more
marked. It is doubtless for this reason that
many of the poems carry with them a note
of conscious ingenuousness, as if their simplest
effects had been deliberately achieved. Not
so, however, such poems as “The Inn,” “The
Drudge,” “Sins,” “The Anointed,” “The
Walk,” whose words are quick with native
impulse, as the trenchant lines of the third:</p>

<p>Two poems contained in <cite>The Singing Leaves</cite>

<p>Here speaks a word from life worth a score
of “Charms: To Be Said In The Sun,” or
other fanciful unreality; and because of such
poems as this, fibred in human motive, one
feels by contrast in many of the others that
Miss Peabody has been playing with her genius,
casting “Charms” and “Spells,” which are
mere poetic sorcery.</p>

<p>Miss Peabody has a rare sympathy with child-life,
and her group of poems of this nature
could not well be bettered. With the exception
of a line now and then which may be a
bit beyond the expression of a child, they are
fidelity itself to the moods that swayed <cite>The
Little Past</cite>. “Journey,” “The Busy Child,”
and “The Mystic” are among the best, though
none could be spared, unless, perhaps, “Cakes
and Ale.” Still another with the true child-feeling
is that called “Late,”&mdash;a tender little
song which, because of its brevity, must suffice
to represent the group:</p>

<p>Miss Peabody’s work, considered in its entirety,
is distinguished by an art of rare grace
and delicacy, by imagination and vision, susceptibility
to the finer impressions, and by an ever-present
ideality; and while it lacks somewhat
the element of personal emotion and passion,
it has a sympathy subtle and spiritual, if less
intimate in its revealing.</p>

<h4>CHARLES G. D. ROBERTS</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">MR. CHARLES G. D. ROBERTS
presents so marked an example of
evolution in the style of his work
and the sources of his inspiration, that he
has from volume to volume, like the nautilus,
“changed his last year’s dwelling for the new,”
and having entered the “more stately mansion”
has “known the old no more.”</p>

<p>The first chamber which he fashioned for
himself in the House of Art could not long
contain him, as its walls were built of myths
and traditions, incapable of further expansion.
This was the period of <cite>Orion and Other Poems</cite>,
such as “Ariadne,” “Memnon,” and “Launcelot
And The Four Queens,” work done prior
to 1880 and creditable to the initial effort of
a young collegian.</p>

<p>The second lodging was scarcely more
permanent; though structured less in myth,
and showing a gain in workmanship, it was
still too narrow a dwelling for an expanding
spirit, and did little more than give foretokens
<!--159.png-->
of that which should succeed it. The volume
contained, however, one admirable composition,
one that remains as vital and apposite as when
it was written,&mdash;the stirring stanzas to Canada.
Indeed, the fine courage, the higher loyalty
that distinguishes this appeal, lifts it from the
mere grandiloquent utterance of a young man
with over-hasty convictions, to a noble arraignment,
and leads one to wonder why other
poets of her domain do not turn their pens
to revealing her to herself as does this fine
utterance.</p>

<p>Mr. Roberts’ third volume, <cite>Songs of the
Common Day</cite>, bore almost no relation to its
predecessors, and might have been the work of
a different hand, as regards both subject and
style. Legend and myth had wholly disappeared,
and experience had begun to furnish the
raw material, the flax, for the poet’s spindle and
distaff which earlier effort had been making
ready. Not yet, however, had the work the
virility and tang that smack in the very first
line of its successor, <cite>The Book of the Native</cite>.
It was graceful, artistic singing, but lacking,
except in a few instances, the large free note
that sounds in the later work. Among its
lyrics is one of exquisite tenderness, as sad and
sweet as Tennyson’s “Break, break, break,” and
<!--160.png-->
in the sifting of the volume, this remains, perhaps,
the sand of gold:</p>

<p>“The Tide on Tantramar,” from the third
volume, a ballad of the sea and the salt marshes,
transfers to the page the keen pungence of the
brine, as do the descriptive stanzas of Tantramar
used illustratively in the “Ave” to Shelley.
There is noble work in this elegy, and while
it wanders over a good deal of Canadian territory,
making inspired observations of nature
<!--161.png-->
<!--162.png-->
<!--163.png-->
before it discloses their relation to the subject&mdash;when
the comparison is reached it is apposite,
and the poem shows an insight into the
character of Shelley that is gratifying, in view of
the vagueness usually associated with his name.</p>

<p>Other <cite>Songs of the Common Day</cite>, forelooking
to the later poet, are “The Silver Thaw,”
“Canadian Streams,” and “The Wood Frolic,”
having the first-hand, magnetic touch distinguishing
every line of Mr. Roberts’ out-of-door
verse in that volume which first truly reveals
him,&mdash;<cite>The Book of the Native</cite>. So conscious
is one of a new force in this book that it would

<p>This sounds the keynote to <cite>The Book of
the Native</cite>, which is equally concerned with
the enigmas of the soul and the mysteries of
nature. The questing spirit is abroad in it;
the unquenched faith, the vitality, the hidden
import of life is in it; and while its metaphysics
do not go to the point of developing a
definite philosophy, they set one to thinking for
himself, which is a better service. “Origins,”
a speculation as to our coming from “the enigmatic
Will,” and the “Unsleeping,” a vision of
the Force brooding over life,&mdash;are among the
strongest poems of this motive. To cite the

<p>Mr. Roberts has the rare pictorial gift of
flashing a scene before one without employing
an excess of imagery, and never that which is
confused or cumbrous. His style is nervous,
magnetic, direct, and has, in his later work,
very little superfluous tissue. This statement,
has, of course, its exceptions, but is sufficiently
accurate to be made a generalization,
and in no case is it better shown than in the
<!--166.png-->
descriptive poems of the Canadian country in
<cite>The Book of the Native</cite>. What is there about
Canada that sets the blood of her poets a-tingle
and lends magic to their fingers when writing
of her? What is there in Grand Pré’s “barren
reaches by the tide,” or in the marshes of
Tantramar, that such a spell should wait upon
them, calling the roamer</p>

<p>With the American poets of the present day,
despite their feeling for nature, it is rather
her beauty in the abstract than any particular
locality with which they chance to be associated,
that inspires them,&mdash;though Mr.
Cawein, in his allegiance to Kentucky, furnishes
a marked exception to this statement,&mdash;but
the Canadian poets, with a passion like
that of a lover, sing of the haunts that knew
their first devotion: now with a buoyant infectious
note, now with a reminiscent sadness;
in short, the Canadian poets seem to have a
sympathetic identity with their country, an interchange
of personality by which they reciprocally
express each other.</p>

<p>Particularly is this true of Bliss Carman,
Duncan Campbell Scott, and Charles G. D.
<!--167.png-->
Roberts; and it was equally true of Archibald
Lampman, whose untimely passing lost to
Canada one of her anointed singers, to whose
high promise justice has hardly yet been done.
To illustrate Mr. Roberts’ nature-sympathy,
and susceptibility to the mood of the year, let
me put in contrast parts of two poems from <cite>The
Book of the Native</cite>. The first belongs to the
racy note pervading a good deal of the nature-verse
of to-day, of which the Vagabondia books
set the fashion: it is called “Afoot,” but might
with equal aptness be named the “Processional,”
since the second is the “Recessional”:</p>

<p>And to make the season-cycle complete, and
also to show the delicacy of imagination with
<!--169.png-->
which Mr. Roberts invests every changing
aspect of his well-loved outer world, here are
two stanzas on “The Frosted Pane”:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">One night came Winter noiselessly, and leaned</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Against my window-pane.</div>
  <div class="verse">In the deep stillness of his heart convened</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">The ghosts of all his slain.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Leaves, and ephemera, and stars of earth,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And fugitives of grass,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">White spirits loosed from bonds of mortal birth,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">He drew them on the glass.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>Fancies as exquisite as this bespeak the true
poet. “The Trout Brook” and “The Solitary
Woodsman” are other inspirations as individual.</p>

<p>Mr. Roberts’ fifth volume, <cite>New York Nocturnes</cite>,
as its name implies, was a decided departure
from his former work, showing his
versatility, but what is more to the purpose,
his recognition of the dramatic element, the
human, vital poetry in the babel of the streets.
One could wish that the <cite>Nocturnes</cite> penetrated
more profoundly into the varied phases of life
in the great seething city, that, in short, they
sounded other deeps than those of love; but
Mr. Roberts has succeeded in conveying that
sense of isolation in a throng, that heavy loneliness
and reaction, throwing one back upon
<!--170.png-->
his own spiritual personality, which belongs to
the bewildering city night, and from which the
finer companionships of love arise as a refuge
and need.</p>

<p>The <cite>Nocturnes</cite> have the city’s over-soul
incarnate in them; for in the last analysis, the
commerce, the art, the ambition, the strife, the
defeat, that one may term the city’s life, are
but as hands and feet to minister to the spirit
of love. The first of the <cite>Nocturnes</cite> suggests
this:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">I walk the city square with thee,</div>
  <div class="verse">The night is loud; the pavements roar<a name="chg3" id="chg3"></a>.</div>
  <div class="verse">Their eddying mirth and misery</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Encircle thee and me.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The street is full of lights and cries:</div>
  <div class="verse">The crowd but brings thee close to me,</div>
  <div class="verse">I only hear thy low replies;</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">I only see thine eyes.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>The “Nocturne of Consecration” is impassioned
and full of spirituality; it is, however, too
long to quote, which is unfortunately the case
with the “Nocturne of the Honeysuckle,” another
of the finer poems. “At the Station” is
instinct with movement, reproducing the picture
of the swiftly changing throngs, and conveying
the eager expectancy of the hour of meeting.
The <cite>Nocturnes</cite> have also a group of miscellaneous
<!--171.png-->
poems, and the volume as a whole,
while less virile than <cite>The Book of the Native</cite>,
owing to the difference in theme, is distinguished
by refinement of feeling and artistry.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Book of the Rose</cite> Mr. Roberts has
done some excellent work, and some, alas, that
strikes a decided note of artificiality. The
least real and convincing of the poems is that
called “On the Upper Deck,” which opens the
volume. The first stanza is subtly phrased,
and also the lyric which occurs midway of the
poem; but the dialogue between the lovers
is honeyed poetizing rather than genuine emotion.
I find few heart-throbs in it, but rather a
melodramatic sentimentality from whose flights
one is now and again let down to the common
day with summary despatch, as in the parenthetical
clause of the stanza which follows:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Let us not talk of roses. Don’t you think</div>
  <div class="verse">The engine’s pulse throbs louder now the light</div>

<p>It may be that an obtuse man upon the deck
of a steamer would interrupt his sweetheart’s
<!--172.png-->
flight of poesy to envelop her in a shawl, but
the details of the matter may well be left to the
imagination. It is doubtless one of those passages
which seem to a writer to give reality to
a picture, but afterward smile at him sardonically
from the printed page. Mr. Roberts inclines
elsewhere in the same poem to be too
explicit; after a most exalted declaration, he
says:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">No, do not move! Alone although we be</div>
  <div class="verse">I dare not touch your hand; your gown’s dear hem</div>

  <div class="verse">And just an empty deck-chair mock my longing.</div>

<p>Here again it was scarcely necessary to qualify
the chair, and indeed the whole passage savors
of melodrama. These are, however, only such
lines as show that to the one relating a matter
the least incident may appear to lend reality to
the setting, whereas to the reader the detail
may violate taste.</p>

<p>The opening stanza, mentioned as one of the
truly subtle bits of the poem in question, has
these fine lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">As the will of last year’s wind,</div>
  <div class="verse">As the drift of the morrow’s rain,</div>

  <div class="verse">As the treason sinned in vain,</div>

  <div class="verse">As the bow that shines and is gone,</div>
  <div class="verse">As the night cry heard no more,&mdash;</div>

  <div class="verse">Beyond man’s eldest lore.</div>

<p>This stanza and the lyric below, which is sung
as an interlude to the dialogue, go far toward
redeeming the over-ripe sentiment of the poem:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">O Rose, blossom of mystery, holding within your deeps</div>
  <div class="verse">The hurt of a thousand vigils, the heal of a thousand sleeps,</div>
  <div class="verse">There breathes upon your petals a power from the ends of the earth,</div>
  <div class="verse">Your beauty is heavy with knowledge of life and death and birth.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">O Rose, blossom of longing&mdash;the faint suspense, and the fire,</div>
  <div class="verse">The wistfulness of time, and the unassuaged desire,</div>

  <div class="verse">With these your spirit is weary, with these your beauty is fed.</div>

<p>The remaining poems of the volume are
much more artistic than the first, with the
exception of the passages last quoted. “The
Rose of Life” is artistically wrought as to
form and metre, and subtle in analysis; but,
because of its length and that it voices somewhat
the same thought as the lyric above, the
former must serve to show with what delicacy
<!--174.png-->
of interpretation he approaches a theme so well
worn, but ever new, as that of the rose. It is
chiefly on the symbolistic side that Mr. Roberts
considers the subject; and while one may
feel that the sentiment cloys at times when a
group of poems using the rose as an image are
bracketed together, this is the chief criticism
of the volume, as the lyrics following the opening
poem, “On the Upper Deck,” have both
charm and art, and one hesitates between such
an one as, “O Little Rose, O Dark Rose,” and
the one immediately following it, “The Rose of
My Desire.” This, perhaps, has a more compelling
mood, though no greater charm of touch
than the other:</p>

<p>departing as it does from the general scheme

make “soul” bisyllabic in order to carry the

“who shall arbitrate”? Mr. Roberts rarely
offends the ear in his metres, but instead his
cadences are notably true.</p>

<p>Aside from the poems upon love, filling the
first division of <cite>The Book of the Rose</cite> it has
a miscellaneous group, of which the two that
best represent it, to my fancy, are so widely
diverse that their mere mention in juxtaposition
is amusing; nevertheless they are the lines “To
An Omar Punch Bowl,” and the reverent Nativity
Song, “When Mary, the Mother, Kissed the
Child.” The haunting couplets of the former
are by no means of the convivial sort, but the
essence of memory and desire, the pathos of
this dust that is but “wind that hurries by,”&mdash;is
in them. However, to be quoted, they need
their full context, as does the Nativity Song
mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Roberts has a rare sympathy with childhood,
and a gift of reaching the hearts of the
little ones; the “Sleepy Man” and “Wake-up
Song” could scarcely be improved; note the
picturing in the former and the drowsihood in
its falling cadences:</p>

<p>Mr. Roberts has collected his several volumes,
exclusive of <cite>The Book of the Rose</cite>, into one,
eliminating such of the earlier work as falls short
of his standard of criticism, and adding new
matter showing growth and constantly broadening
affinity with life. He manifests more and
more the potentialities of his nature, and while
all of his later work does not ring equally true,
the majority of it is instinct with sincerity and
high idealism, and one may go to it for unforced,
unconventional song, having art without trammels,
for a breath of the ozone of nature, and
<!--178.png-->
for suggestive thoughts upon life and the
things of the spirit. Its creed is epitomized in

<h3><a name="Thomas" id="Thomas"></a><abbr title="Eight">VIII</abbr></h3>

<h4>EDITH M. THOMAS</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">AN earnest idealist is Miss Edith Thomas,
who commits to her song a vital word
and sends it as a courier to arouse that
drowsy lodge-keeper, the soul, and bid him
give ear to the importunate message of life.
Not by outwardly strenuous numbers, however,
is this end achieved; on the contrary, Miss
Thomas is a quiet singer whose thoughtful
restraint is one of her chief distinctions. The
spiritual tidings which she intrusts to her song
are destined to be delivered in the silence of
the soul; none the less are they sent to
awaken it, and none the less do they bide and
knock at the door of one’s spirit until one rise
and open to them.</p>

<p>The ideality of her work has been from the
outset its most informing quality; the thoughts
beyond the thrall of words that pass, in Maeterlinck’s
phrase, “like great white birds, across
the heart,” had brushed with their unsullied
wings the thoughts of every-day and left a
light upon them, giving assurance, when the
<!--180.png-->
art was still unshapen, that the vision had
been revealed. One seldom reads a poem
by Miss Thomas without bringing away from
it a suggestive thought or a spiritual stimulus,
sometimes introduced so subtly that it breaks
upon one in the after-light of memory rather
than at the moment of reading; for Miss
Thomas is not a homiletic singer, obtruding
the moral. She is too much the artist for that.
She delivers no crass counsel, does no obvious
and commonplace moralizing; but she has the
nature that resolves every phase of life into its
spiritual elements, and, seen imaginatively,
these elements are material for Art. When
once they are wrought into song by Miss
Thomas, they have lost none of the force of
the original idea, none of the thought-giving
value; but into them has been infused the
spiritual value in a subtly philosophical way,
by which the experience is resolved into its
personal import to the soul.</p>

<p>Miss Thomas has written many beautiful
lyrics, but her characteristic expression is too
thoughtful to be set to the lighter and more
purely musical rhythms. She has a finely cultivated
style, inventive in form, and often employing
richly cadenced measures, but one feels
rather that the cadence is well tested, the
<!--181.png-->
form well fitted to the theme, than that the
impulse created its own form and sang itself
into being. One cannot, however, generalize
upon such varied work as that of Miss Thomas.
Because one feels back of the work the thinker,
the analyst, weighing even the emotion in the
balance of reflection, is not to say that the
work is cold or unemotional; on the contrary,
it is deeply human and sympathetic, and in
such inspirations as are drawn directly from
life it is often highly impassioned; but in many
of the poems the motive is drawn from some
classic source, such as, “At Seville,” “Ulysses
at the Court of Alcinous,” “The Roses of
Pieria,” “Timon to the Athenians,” “The Voice
of the Laws,” being Socrates’ reply to Crito,&mdash;and
while each of these poems, and particularly
the last, has both beauty and strength, they naturally
lack the warmth and impulse that accompany
more personal themes.</p>

<p>As compared with the large body of Miss
Thomas’ work, that for which the inspiration
has been sought far afield is slight; but it is
sufficient to set the mark of deliberate intent
upon many of the poems and detract from
the spontaneity of the work as a whole. Miss
Thomas is so accomplished and ready a technician
that the temptation to utilize such allusions
<!--182.png-->
and themes from literature as have
artistic possibilities, is a strong one; nor is it
one to be deprecated, except in the ultimate
tendency that one shall let the inspiration from
without take precedence of that within, thus
quenching one’s own creative faculty. With
Miss Thomas such a result is far distant, if not
impossible, for life is to her the vital reality,
and the majority of her themes are drawn from
its passing drama; but there is also the other
phase of her art, and a sufficiently prominent
one to be noted. Her work falls under two
distinct heads,&mdash;poetry of the intellect and
poetry of the heart,&mdash;and while her most emotional
verse has a fine subtlety of thought, and
her most intellectual a subtlety of emotion,
making them not crassly one or the other,
none the less is the distinction apparent, and
it is easy to put one’s hand upon the work into
which her own temperament has entered and
which her creative moods have shaped. Upon
Art itself she has written some of her most
luminous poems, holding genius to be one with
that force by which</p>

<p>In her poem, “The Compass,” she carries the
reasoning farther, and declares that if one is to
wait upon the Force within and give it freedom,
he shall also be trusted to follow where it leads,
knowing that if temporarily deflected it will
adjust itself to the truth as surely as the compass,
thrown momentarily out of poise, searches
and finds its compelling attraction. Aside
from the analogy in the lines, the dignity of
their movement, the harmonious fall of the
cæsura, and the fine blending of word and tone,
render them highly artistic:</p>

<p>These lines illustrate Miss Thomas’ command
of accurately descriptive phrase: the compass is
“mobile and frail as a tremulous spheret of
dew,” and touched never so lightly, “how it
drifts, and trembles, and searches on every side.”
One feels that just these words, and no others,
convey at once the sense of its delicacy, and
the almost sentient instinct by which it seeks
its attraction. Miss Thomas’ diction in general
shows rather fineness of discrimination in the
expressive value of words than a strenuous
attempt to seek out those which are “literary”
and inobvious. There is rarely a word that
calls undue attention to itself; but when a
passage or poem is analyzed, one cannot but note
the fine sense of values in its phraseology. Her
diction has elegance without conventionality,
but one would scarcely say that it is highly
temperamental. It is flexible, colorful, picturesque,
but has not so strong a note of personality
<!--186.png-->
that one meeting a poem of Miss Thomas’ by
chance would be able to identify it by its evidence
of word and phrase, as one may often do
in the work of a poet. Miss Thomas’ marked
individuality is rather in the essence of her
work, its motive, mood, and thought, than in
its distinctive style, which is too varied to be
recognized by its touch.</p>

<p>Now and again in her earlier work the influence
of Emerson comes out unmistakably. “A
Reed Shaken With the Wind,” “Child and
Poet,” and “The Naturalist,” are distinctly
Emersonian in manner and atmosphere&mdash;the
first especially so in its consecutive, unstanzaed
lines, and in the note pervading it. Whatever
mannerisms of style Miss Thomas acquired
from Emerson were, however, quickly cast off;
but with his thought she could scarcely fail to
have a continued kinship, if not a debt, so
much does her own work incline to the spiritually
philosophical. One may not trace influences
at all definitely in her work, though felt
in its general enrichment and breadth. In
“Palingenesis,” from her last collection, she has
done what poets before her have done,&mdash;embody
in song the theory of evolution; but it has
rarely been done better than in these stanzas,
which seize the spiritual side of the scientific
<!--187.png-->
fact and fuse it with the imagination. It has
been shudderingly foreboded that in this baldly
practical age the poet would come singing of
science; but if he invest it with the life and
charm that pervade Miss Thomas’ incursion
into the realm, there is no immediate cause for
alarm. Indeed, a scientific truth, seen through
the lens of a poet’s imagination, often takes on
a beauty that no conception of fancy could
duplicate, witness Whitman’s line:</p>

<p>There is no internal evidence in these
strongly phrased and stirring lines that a
woman’s hand penned them; their vigor, grasp,
<!--190.png-->
and resonant freedom of measure would do
credit to Browning; and here one may pause
to observe the adaptability of Miss Thomas’
style to her thought. In certain poems demanding
the delicate airy touch, such as, “Dew-Bells,”
Titania herself could scarcely speak in
lighter phrase, nor could a tenderer, sweeter
note be infused into a poem than has been put
into the lines: “The soul of the violet haunts
me so,” or into the poem incident to the
query, “Is it Spring again in Ohio?”&mdash;but
when the thought demands virility of word and
measure Miss Thomas has a vivid energy of
style, masculine in its force. One may argue
that there is no sex in poetry, that, coming close
home for illustration, a woman’s hand might
have fashioned the work of Longfellow and
Whittier; but what of Lowell, Whitman, and
Emerson? These names alone prove sex-evidence
in art; nor is any disparagement
meant to Longfellow and Whittier that their
characteristic notes were of the gentler, sweeter
sort. We know they could be sufficiently robust
upon occasion, particularly the latter; but,
in general, art obeys a temperamental polarity
giving evidence of the masculine or feminine
mind that produced it. Miss Thomas’ work
in the main proves the woman, and the typical
<!--191.png-->
woman, who has lived, suffered, joyed; drank,
indeed, the brimming beaker from the foam to
the lees; but on her more philosophical and
intellectual side, in such poems as “The Voice
of the Laws,” or “The Flutes of the Gods” and
in many others, she has all a man’s virility. It
is partly for this reason that her style is too
varied to be identified by a random poem, the
temperamental differences in the work are so
marked, and the style changes so entirely
with them, as to elude classification under
one head.</p>

<p>Miss Thomas is very keen to see what may be
termed the subjectively dramatic side of life,&mdash;all
the subtlety of motive and impulse working
out of sight to shape the destiny, she sees with
acute divination; but constructively she lacks
the dramatic touch. In “A Winter Swallow,”
her one definite incursion into this field, it cannot
be said that she has done such work as
would represent her at her real value either in
the literary beauty of the lines, or in the insight
displayed in the characterization.</p>

<p>So short a dramatic effort, however, could
scarcely do more than indicate the likelihood or
unlikelihood of Miss Thomas’ success in a more
sustained plot; and while a theme having in itself
warmer elements of sympathy would doubtless
create for itself a more moving and vital art, there
is very little to indicate that the effort would be
wisely spent. One is inclined more fully to
this opinion by the lack of dramatic impulse
in Miss Thomas’ narrative poem turning upon
the story of Genevra of the Amieri, she who
woke by night from the death-trance to find
herself entombed in the powerful vault of
<!--193.png-->
her ancestors, and, being spurned from her
father’s and her husband’s doors, as a haunting
spirit, took refuge at that of her former lover,
to whom, being adjudged by the law as dead,
she was reunited.</p>

<p>The mere skeleton of this story is palpitant
with life; but in Miss Thomas’ cultivated and
beautiful recital, wherein the well-rounded,
suave pentameter falls never otherwise than
richly on the ear, all the vibrant, thrilling, terrifying
elements of the story have been refined
away. When Genevra wakens in the tomb, and
touches in the darkness the human skeletons
about her, and struggles to free herself from
the entangling cerements, and beats with
superhuman strength at the gratings until they
yield to her hand, and to the outer stone
until it unseals at her terrified touch,&mdash;there
are dramatic materials which even history has
infused with red blood; but either Miss Thomas
does not conceive the situation as having thrills
and terrors, or has not been able to impart
them to her record, for she sums the matter up
in these two stanzas, illustrating, apparently,
the Gentle Art of Being Buried Alive:</p>

  <div class="verse">And now she dreams she lies in marble rest</div>

  <div class="verse">As they would soften her untimely doom….</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Nay, living flowers are these that brush her cheek!</div>
  <div class="verse">She starts awake amid the nether gloom,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">From out dead swoon returning faint and weak;</div>
  <div class="verse">No voice hath she, but none might hear her, could she speak.</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">To rescue one in frosty irons long bound,</div>
  <div class="verse">Cheers her new-beating heart, till she has found</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Recourse of memory and use of will.</div>
  <div class="verse">Then soon her feet are on the ladder-round,</div>

  <div class="verse">And now the wide night greets her, bright, and lone, and still.</div>

</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The story of Genevra, as told by Miss Thomas,
has often great beauty of phrase, picturesque
descriptive passages of Florentine life, delicacy
in the scene between the reunited lovers when
Genevra seeks Antonio’s gate, and fine pathos
in the lines spoken by her father to her supposed
spirit returning to haunt him; in short,
the poem has all but the dramatic touch. The
narrative force is lost in the poetic elaboration.</p>

<p>But although Miss Thomas has not the outward
art of the dramatist, she has, as earlier
stated, a keenly intuitive sense of the spiritually
dramatic in passing life. Upon love she has
written with so keen a psychology that certain
<!--195.png-->
of the poems probe to the quick of that source
of pain; for it is not the lighter phase, already
so well celebrated, that she sings, but oftener the
fateful, the inexplicable. For illustration, the
poem, “They Said,” presents the caprice of love
by which (they say), it goes to those who hold
it most lightly, spend it most prodigally, flee it
to entice it, and yet weave snares to detain it.
The thrust of these stanzas is as delicately
keen as a rapier point:</p>

<p>Every contradiction of passion is in this poem,
and the very refinement of satire, as well.
In “The Domino,” Miss Thomas images, with
a pleasant humor, the various disguises under
which one meets Love, and symbolizes in “The
Barrier” the infallible intuition, the psychic
sense, by which one feels a change not yet
apparent.</p>

<p>“A Home-Thrust,” wherein the inconstant

<p>It is in such poems as bring from the heart
of life a certain poignant strain that Miss
Thomas is at her best. She is not a melancholy
singer, but her work is too deeply rooted
in the pain and unrest of life to be joyous. A
certain longing, an almost impalpable sadness,
pervades much of her verse. Nevertheless, it
is not so emphasized as to be depressing, and,
indeed, adds just the touch of personality by
which one treasures that which he feels has
been fused in experience. This pertains to
the more intimate phases of Miss Thomas’
work. Upon death she has written with
deep feeling and insight,&mdash;feeling all too
vital to be analyzed, such as renders Spring
the season</p>

<!--199.png-->
for it an intense passion, and enters into its
most delicate and undefined moods with swift
comprehension.</p>

<p>“The Soul of the Violet,” previously referred

<p>The subjective touch in the final couplet gives
the key-note to the poem.</p>

<p>Miss Thomas is indeed so subjective in her
conception of some of the profounder and more
vital losses of life, the sense of the irrevocable
and irreparable is so keenly emphasized to her
mind as to communicate almost a hint of fatalism
to certain of her poems, such as “Expiation”
and “A Far Cry To Heaven.” The latter is
such an utterance, in its impassioned tone, as
might proceed from the lips of the Angel with
the Flaming Sword sent to bar one’s return to
his desecrated Eden. The ultimate effect of
such a poem, however, is salutary, as the warning
outruns the scath, and one reading it will
pay closer heed to the import of the “white
hour” of his life. On its technical side, the
poem has all the ease of an improvisation, and
so at one are the metre and thought that line
succeeds line with a surge and a rhythm, as
wave follows wave to the shore:</p>

Maeterlinck laid his philosophy by to
observe with infinite pains the habits of the
bee and to record, without the intrusion of too
many deductions, the amazing facts as nature
passed them in review before his eyes,&mdash;he
became the naturalist-philosopher, selling days,
not for speculations, but for laws. To the
poet also has come the desire which came to
the philosopher to demonstrate the truth within
the beauty; to penetrate to the finer law at
the heart of things; in short, there has arisen
what one may term the poet-naturalist, and in
the recent work of Mr. Madison Cawein we
have perhaps the most characteristic illustration
among our own poets of the younger
school, of this phase of nature-interpretation.</p>

<p>Before considering it, however, one must
trace briefly Mr. Cawein’s evolutionary steps
<!--206.png-->
through the haunted ways of nature in its
imaginative and romantic phases, which enthralled
him first, by no means wholly, but
predominantly, and of which he has left many
records in his volume, <cite>Myth and Romance</cite>.
Of the more artistic poems, worthy to be put
in comparison with his later work, there are
several from the opening group of the collection,
as these picturesque lines containing the
query:</p>

<!--211.png-->
<p>This, however, is airy imagination as compared
with the naturalist fidelity of much of Mr.
Cawein’s work in <cite>Weeds by the Wall</cite>, <cite>A Voice
on the Wind</cite>, and in <cite>Kentucky Poems</cite>,&mdash;to
which Mr. Edmund Gosse contributes a
sympathetic introduction,&mdash;books chiefly
upon nature, occasionally reverting to the
mythological or more imaginative phase of
the subject, but in the main set to reveal the
fact, with its aura of beauty; for it is never the
purely elemental side of a nature-manifestation
that presents itself to Mr. Cawein, but always
the fact haloed by its poetic penumbra. Indeed,
the limitation of his earlier work lay in the
excess of fancy over reflection and art; but
his growth has been away from the romantic
toward the realistic and individual, and upon this
side its best assurance for the future is given.
Mr. Cawein has yet far too facile a pen not to
be betrayed by it into excesses both of production
and fancy. He writes too much to keep to
the standard set in his best work of the past two
or three years, and lacks still to a great degree
the self-scrutiny which would reject much that
he includes; but granting all this, it must be
apparent to any reader of his work that he is
not a singer making verse for diversion, but
one to whom poetry is the very breath of his
<!--212.png-->
spirit, one who lives by this air, and can by no
other; and while it is one thing to be driven
through vision-haunted days by beauty’s urgence
and unrest, and another to body forth
the vision in the calm; one thing to have had
the mystery whispered by a thousand wordless
voices, and another to communicate it in terms of
revealing truth&mdash;it is notable in Mr. Cawein’s
verse that he is teaching his hand to obey him
more surely each year, and is producing work
that quickens one’s perception of the world
without, and adds to his sum of beauty. It is
serious work, work with purpose, and while its
fancy still runs at times to the fantastic, it
shows so marked a growth in technique and
spirit from year to year that one may well let
to-morrow take care of to-morrow with a poet
who brings to his art the ideal which inspires
Mr. Cawein.</p>

<p>To return, then, to his distinctive field, Kentucky,
and his characteristic note of nature, one
observes that a hand-book of the flora of his
state could doubtless be compiled from his
poems, so do they leave the beaten path in their
range of observation; but it would be a botany
plus imagination and sympathy, analysts keener
than microscopes, and in it would be recorded
the habits of the bluet, the jewel-weed, the
<!--213.png-->
celandine, the black-cohosh, the bell-flower, the
lobelia, the elecampane, the oxalis, the touch-me-not,
the Indian-pipe, and many another
unused to hear its name rehearsed in song.</p>

<p>Autumn is apparently, however, little to his
liking, and in his attitude toward it he reveals
the Southerner; for it is not only Kentucky
flora and fauna, but Kentucky climate which
Mr. Cawein celebrates, treating Autumn not
with the buoyancy that to a Northerner renders
it a season of lusty infection, but almost wholly
in its aspect of sadness. In his volume called
<cite>Undertones</cite> he has a group of poems upon
<!--214.png-->
the withdrawing year, sounding only this note,
which is the prevalent one when touching
upon the same theme in his other volumes.

<p>Winter is encountered with far scantier cheer,
and rarely receives the grace of salutation, as
its face appears dire and malevolent to this
lover of the sun. To follow Mr. Cawein’s work
with such a purpose in view would be to present
an interesting study in climatic psychology, for
though no mention were made of the section
in which he writes, the internal evidence is
sufficient to localize the poems. Not alone
the gracious side of the Southern summer is
presented, but the fearful time of drouth when</p>

<p>Immediately following the poem upon “Drouth,”
of which there are several stanzas sketched with
minuteness, occurs one entitled “Before the
Rain,” opening with these pictorial lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Before the rain, low in the obscure east,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Weak and morose the moon hung, sickly gray;</div>
  <div class="verse">Around its disc the storm mists, cracked and creased,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Wove an enormous web, wherein it lay</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Like some white spider hungry for its prey.</div>
  <div class="verse">Vindictive looked the scowling firmament,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">In which each star, that flashed a dagger ray,</div>
  <div class="verse">Seemed filled with malice of some dark intent.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The moon caught in its creased web of storm
mists is another well-visioned image. Mr.
Cawein carries the record on to a third poem,
picturing the “Broken Drouth;” all are notable
for the infusion of atmosphere,&mdash;climatic
atmosphere, in this case; and indeed of this
palpable sort there is plenty, infused into words
that fairly parch the page in such poems as
<!--216.png-->
“Heat,” or “To the Locust,” which give
abundant evidence that Mr. Cawein knows
whereof he speaks and is not supposing a
case. The stanzas to “The Grasshopper”
will deepen this conviction when one looks
them up in the volume called <cite>Weeds by the
Wall</cite>.</p>

<p>Mr. Cawein has poems in celebration of
many other of the creatures whom he links
in fellowship with man in his keenly observant
verse. “The Twilight Moth,” “The
Leaf Cricket,” “The Tree Toad,” “The Chipmunk,”
and even the despised “Screech-Owl,”
are observed and celebrated with impartial sympathy
and love. He shelters in the wood during
a summer rain to learn where each tiny
fellow of the earth and air bestows himself,
and notes that the “lichen-colored moths”
are pressed “like knots against the trunks of
trees;” that the bees are wedged like “clots
of pollen” in hollow blooms, and that the
“mantis, long-clawed, furtive, lean,” and the
dragonfly are housed together beneath the wild-grape’s
leaves and gourds. Each creature’s
haunt, ’neath rock or root, or frail roof-bloom,
is determined as a naturalist might lie in wait
during the summer storm to record for Science’s
sake each detail of this forest tenantry.
<!--217.png-->
Imagination has, however, touched it to beauty,
while losing none of the fidelity.</p>

<p>To the “Twilight Moth,” “gnome wrought
of moonbeam fluff and gossamer,” he addresses
in another poem these delicate lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Dusk is thy dawn; when Eve puts on her state</div>

  <div class="verse">Or, of a rose, the visible wish; that, white,</div>
  <div class="verse">Goes softly messengering through the night,</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">Veiled snowy faces,&mdash;that no bee might greet</div>
  <div class="verse">Or butterfly that, weighed with pollen, passed;&mdash;</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Cool-throated flowers that avoid the day’s</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">Nocturnes of fragrance, thy winged shadow links</div>
  <div class="verse">In bonds of secret brotherhood and faith;</div>

</div><!--end container-->

<p>The final line of this stanza has a certain thinness,
and in that above, the ending which turns
“sweet” to a noun is too evidently a matter
<!--218.png-->
of expediency; but with these exceptions the
stanzas are charming, as are the unquoted
ones following them. Before turning to other
phases of Mr. Cawein’s work, here is a glimpse
of the “Tree Toad,” pictured with quaint delicacy
and fancy:</p>

<p>What a happy bit of realism is that of the toadstool
“bulging, moony white, through loosening
loam”! The second of the stanzas may
be too Keats-like in atmosphere to have been
achieved with unconsciousness of the fact, be
that as it may, it is a bit of sheer beauty, as the
last is of dainty fancy.</p>

<p>But nature, either realistically or romantically,
is not all that Mr. Cawein writes of,
though it must be said that his verse upon
other themes is so largely tinctured with his
nature passion that one rarely comes upon a
poem whose illustrations are not drawn more
or less from this source, making it difficult to
find lyrics wholly upon other themes. Because
of his opulent metrical variety, Mr. Cawein is
less lyrical than as if he sang in simpler measures.
His lyrics, indeed, are in the main his
least distinguished work, having frequently, if
highly musical, too slight a motive; or if more
consequent in motive, not being sufficiently
musical; or the melody may be unimpeachable
and the theme too romantic to have convincing
value, as “Mignon,” “Helen,” “The
<!--220.png-->
Quest,” “Floridian,” etc. Indeed, Mr. Cawein
sounds the troubadour note all too frequently in
his lyrical love poems, which are not without
a lightsome grace of phrase and fancy, as becomes
this style of verse; but it is likely to
be a superficial note, heard but to be forgotten.
He can, however, strike a deeper chord,
as in the poem called “The End of All,” or in
that from an earlier volume, bringing a poignant
undertone in its strong, calm utterance,
beginning</p>

<p>In such notes as these controlled by the Vox
Humana stop, Mr. Cawein best reveals himself;
another, coming from the heart rather than the
fancy, is “Nightshade,” from the volume called
<cite>Intimations of the Beautiful</cite>, a record of life’s
bringing to judgment the late-proffered love,
unyielded when desired.</p>
<!--221.png-->

<p>“A Wild Iris” is in the later and finer manner,
but although love is the spirit of the song,
it is embodied chiefly in terms of nature, and
would not reveal a different phase of his work
from that already shown. This, too, is the case
with the two lighter lyrics, “Love In A Day”
and “In The Lane,” each with a most taking
measure; the second a rural song lilting into
this note:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>Mr. Cawein has frequent poems in celebration
of the farm, not only its picturesque cheer,
but its dignity and finer idealism. “A Song

<p>Mr. Cawein blends the mood and the picture
in the simple tenderness of these lines,
with their unstriving felicity. Kentucky’s more
strenuous side also finds a chronicler in his
verse: the tragedies of its mountains are told
in one of the earlier volumes in such poems as
“The Moonshiner,” “The Raid,” and “Dead
Man’s Run;” and in <cite>Weeds by the Wall</cite>, in
that graphic poem “Feud,” sketching with the

<p>Mr. Howells, in an appreciation of Mr. Cawein’s
work, after the appearance of <cite>Weeds by the
Wall</cite>, spoke of this poem declaring that “What
makes one think he will go far and long, and
outlive both praise and blame, is the blending
of a sense of the Kentucky civilization in such
a poem as ‘Feud.’ Civilization may not be
quite the word for the condition of things suggested
here, but there can be no doubt of the
dramatic and the graphic power that suggests
it, and that imparts a personal sense of the
tragic squalor, the sultry drouth, the forlorn
wickedness of it all.” His poem “Ku Klux,”
in a volume published some time ago, is no
less dramatic in touch and theme. Mr. Cawein
knows how to set his picture; the ominous
portent of the night in which the dark deed
is done would be understood from these three
lines alone:</p>

<!--224.png-->

  <div class="verse">The clouds blow heavy towards the moon.</div>

</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>It may be said of Mr. Cawein’s work in
general that it shows him to be alert to impression,
and gives abundant evidence that life
presents itself to him abrim with suggestion.
Occasionally, as mentioned above, he wanders
too far into the romantic, or yields to the
rhyming impulse in a fallow time of thought;
but when he throws this facile poetizing by,
and betakes himself to nature and life in the
capacity of observer and analyst, he produces
work notable for its strength, fidelity, and
beauty. Metrically, in his earlier work he was
influenced by various poets he had read too
well. “Intimations of the Beautiful,” occupying
a part of the volume bearing that name,
would be one of his best efforts, in thought
and imaginative charm, were it not written
in a form developed from “In Memoriam,”
so that one is haunted by the metrical echo.
The poem is devoted to interpretations of
life and the spirit, through nature; and has
not a division without some revelation from
that book of the earth which Mr. Cawein
has made his gospel. Its observations, while
couched in imagery that now and again tends
<!--225.png-->
to the over-fanciful, are in the main consistent
and artistic.</p>

<p>In his recent books, however, he adventures
upon his way, seeing wholly by the light of
his own eyes, and portraying by the skill of his
own hand, so that his work has taken on personality
and individuality with each succeeding
volume.</p>

<p>Its breath from the bourns of meadow and
woodland brings with it a stimulating fragrance,
and one closes a book by Mr. Cawein,
feeling that he has been in some charmed spot
under Southern skies where</p>

<h4>GEORGE E. WOODBERRY</h4>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent0a">“For he who standeth in the whole world’s hope</div>
  <div class="verse">Is as a magnet; he shall draw all hearts</div>
  <div class="verse">To be his shield, all arms to strike his blow.”</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p class="dropcap">THESE words by Mr. George E. Woodberry
sound the keynote to his art,
for he has set himself to disclose the
immanence of beauty, of strength; to mould
the real to the ideal; and whether he fashions
a god, as in “Agathon,” or a patriot, as in
“My Country,” he is concerned only with the
development of the spiritual potentialities.</p>

<p>He comes to life, to poetry, enriched by a
scholar’s culture, but limited by his enrichment
on the creative side of his art. He is too
well possessed of the immortal melodies to
trust the spontaneous notes of his own voice,
and hence his verse on its technical side lacks
variety and freedom of movement. It has all
the cultivated, classical freedom, it flows ever
in pure and true numbers; but the masters
sing in its overtones, and one catches himself
hearkening to them as to Mr. Woodberry himself.
<!--227.png-->
In other words, those innovations of
form which strongly creative thoughts usually
bring with them, are not to be found in Mr.
Woodberry’s work. He has a highly developed
sense of rhythm and tone, and very rarely
is any metrical canon violated; but the strange
new music, the wild free note, that showers
down as if from upper air, and sets one’s heart
a-tingling, is seldom voiced through him. The
bird is caged; and while its song is true and
beautiful, one comes soon to know its notes
and the range of its melody.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodberry has, however, something to
say; and if he says it rather with grace and
cultivation as to form, than with any startling
surprises of artistic effect, his work in its essence,
in its spirit, is none the less creative,
and upon this side its strength lies. It is
ethical and intellectual, rather than emotional,
poetry. Though rising often to an impassioned
height, it is a passion of the brain,
pure and cold as a flood of moonlight. Even
the songs of “Wild Eden,” and others dealing
with love, remain an abstraction; one does
not get the sense of personality, except in one
or two of them, such as the lyric, “O, Inexpressible
As Sweet,” and in these few lines
called “Divine Awe”:</p>

<!--228.png-->

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">To tremble when I touch her hands,</div>
  <div class="verse">With awe that no man understands;</div>
  <div class="verse">To feel soft reverence arise</div>
  <div class="verse">When, lover-sweet, I meet her eyes;</div>
  <div class="verse">To see her beauty grow and shine</div>
  <div class="verse">When most I feel this awe divine,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">Whate’er befall me, this is mine;</div>
  <div class="verse">And where about the room she moves,</div>
  <div class="verse">My spirit follows her, and loves.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>But although one misses the sense of reality
in the songs of love, the ideality is for that
reason the more apparent. Love that has
sublimated, taken on the rarer part, that
has made a mystic interchange with nature
and with God, is celebrated in the fervid poem,
“He Ate The Laurel And Is Mad,” which
marks one of the strongest achievements in
Mr. Woodberry’s work, and especially in a
lyric it contains, vibrating with a fine, compulsive
melody. The lines preceding the lyric
relate the coming of Love into the heart of
nature:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">And instant back his longing runs</div>
  <div class="verse">Through bud and billow, through drift and blaze,</div>

  <div class="verse">The spirit journeys from despair;</div>
  <div class="verse">He sees all things that they are fair,</div>
  <div class="verse">But feels them as the daisied sod,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">This slumbrous beauty, this light, this room,</div>
  <div class="verse">The chrysalis and broken tomb</div>
  <div class="verse">He cleaveth on his way to God.</div>

<p>Then the poem breaks into this pæan, whose

<p>Of his recent volume in which he gathers his
most representative work, “The North Shore
Watch,” a threnody published some years ago,
<!--232.png-->
remains one of the truest poems in sincerity and
sympathy of expression,&mdash;not only an idyl of
remembered comradeship, but of the sea in its
many moods; and here one may note that of
Mr. Woodberry’s references to nature, those of
the sea are incomparably the finest, and exhale
an invigorating savor of the brine. They are
scattered through “The North Shore Watch,”
but because of the stately sadness of the verse
are less representative of his characteristic note
than are these buoyant lines which open the
poem “Seaward”:</p>

<p>These lines have the bracing ozone of the

<p>These are pictures in strong color, freehand
records with pigment, of which Mr. Woodberry’s
sea-verse contains many duplicates. He
paints the sea as an impressionist, catching her
evanescent moods. Aside from the pictorial
art of the poem from which the lines above
are taken, it thrills with the gladness that
abides with one coming</p>

<!--234.png-->
<p>Mr. Woodberry is an American, and ever an
American, whatever tribute he may pay at
longer dedicated shrines. His ode to “My
Country” is an impassioned utterance, full of
ideality, and pride in things as they are, not
lacking, however, in the prophetic vision of
what they shall be. He trusts his country
without reservation, recognizes her greater
commission in what has terrified many poets,&mdash;the
absorption of the Eastern isles,&mdash;and bids
her be swift to yield her benefits:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">O, whisper to thy clustered isles</div>
  <div class="verse">If any rosy promise round them smiles;</div>
  <div class="verse">O, call to every seaward promontory</div>
  <div class="verse">If one of them, perchance, is made the cape of glory.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>In technique the ode has a fine sweep and
movement; it thrills with flights of feeling, as
in these lines near the close,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">And never greater love salutes thy brow</div>
  <div class="verse">Than his, who seeks thee now.</div>
  <div class="verse">Alien the sea and salt the foam</div>
  <div class="verse">Where’er it bears him from his home;</div>
  <div class="verse">And when he leaps to land,</div>
  <div class="verse">A lover treads the strand.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The ode is somewhat marred by prolixity,
and now and again by the declamatory impulse
getting the better of the creative; but granting
<!--235.png-->
this it remains a fine rhapsody, redeeming the
time to those who think the days are evil, and
more than ever proving Mr. Woodberry the
idealist, if not, indeed, the prophet. In the
Emerson Ode, read at the centenary in Boston,
there is poem-for-occasion utterance until one
reaches the fourth division, where the rhetoric
gives way to the pensive note,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">I lay the singing laurels down</div>
  <div class="verse">Upon the silent grave,</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>and grows from this into a glimpsing of Emerson’s
most characteristic thought, to which
Mr. Woodberry sings his own indebtedness.
This philosophical résumé has value as critical
interpretation and as tribute to whom tribute
is due, but it lacks the vital spark as poetry.
Odes of this sort are no gauge of a poet’s merit,
and although Mr. Woodberry does not reveal
his weakness in writing of this sort, neither
does he to any marked degree reveal his
strength. It is work of conventional creditability,
reaching occasionally some flight of pure
poetry, but pervaded in general by the perfunctory
note that results from coercing the
muse; and here one may interpolate the wish
that all poems-for-occasion might be “put
upon the list,” for it is certain, not only that
<!--236.png-->
the majority of them “never would be missed,”
but that poetry would rebound from a most
inert weight if lightened of them; nor is this
in any sense personal to Mr. Woodberry, whose
“Emerson Ode” is a far stronger piece of work
than are most compositions of a similar nature.
In the “Player’s Elegy,” in the ode written for
the dedication of Alumni Hall at Phillips Exeter
Academy, and in the several poems addressed
to his fellow-professors at Columbia, there are
also passages of spontaneous force and beauty,
and the high motive of all must not be lost
sight of, but, taken as a whole, this group of
poems could scarcely figure in an appraisal of
the individuality of his work.</p>

<p>It is on the spiritually philosophical side of
his nature that Mr. Woodberry makes his
strongest appeal. He is not primarily a poet of
love, nor of nature, nor a melodist making
music for its own sake; he is an eager, questing
follower of the ideal; proclaimer of the truth
that</p>

<p>He is, indeed, the spirit’s votary, and the ultimate
purport of his message is the recognition
of one’s own spirit force. His poem, “Nay,
Soul,” rebukes the weakness that looks on
every side for that which is within; the nature
that, seeking props, falls by the way; or, craving
understanding, loses the strength that comes
of being misunderstood. It subtly divides the
legitimate gifts of sympathy from those which
weakness demands, and reveals the impossibility
of coercing life, or love, or any good to
which one’s nature is not so magnetized that it
comes to him unentreated. These are potent

<p>The dramatic poem, “Agathon,” which is
builded upon the philosophy of Plato, is perhaps
the most thoughtful and thought-inciting
work in the newly collected volume. It is in
no sense of the word dramatic, but doubtless
cast in this form from its wider adaptability to
the contrasts of thought. The poem is too
lengthy to follow an analysis of its philosophy,
which is wrought out with subtle elaboration,
smacking too much at times of a logical demonstration,
but in the main leavened with imaginative
phrase. Its poetic climax is in the
apostrophe which follows the statement that</p>

<p>Mr. Woodberry’s poetic affiliation with
Tennyson comes out unmistakably in various
other poems, leaving no doubt as to one of the
masters who sing in his over-tones. Here, for
illustration, is a transfusion with Tennyson’s
“Tears, Idle Tears.” One stanza of the flawless
lyric reads:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns</div>
  <div class="verse">The earliest pipe of half-awaken’d birds</div>
  <div class="verse">To dying ears, when unto dying eyes</div>
  <div class="verse">The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;</div>
  <div class="verse">So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>And Mr. Woodberry says:</p>

<!--240.png-->

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">O hidden-strange as on dew-heavy lawns</div>
  <div class="verse">The warm dark scent of summer-fragrant dawns;</div>
  <div class="verse">O tender as the faint sea-changes are,</div>
  <div class="verse">When grows the flush and pales the snow-white star;</div>
  <div class="verse">So strange, so tender, to a maid is love.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->

<p>The mere fact of employing the Tennyson
metre, especially when rhymed, would not give
the sense of over-assimilation of the other’s
work were it not for the marked correspondence
in the diction and atmosphere, the first
line of Tennyson’s lyric being expanded into
the opening couplet of Mr. Woodberry’s stanza,
and the final lines of each having so similar
a terminology. Shelley is a much more operative
force in Mr. Woodberry’s poetry than
Tennyson, but rather in temperamental kinship
than in a technical way. Mr. Woodberry
could scarcely fail to have a keen sympathy
with the passionate art of Shelley, who lived
in the ideal, subtilized and sublimated beyond
all reach but that of longing, but who yet set
his hand and brain to the strife about him. In
his earlier work Mr. Woodberry occasionally
shows the Shelley influence in technique and
theme, but not in his later verse. One can
scarcely understand his leaving in a definitive
collection of his work the poem “Love at the
Door,” whose obligations to Taylor’s “Bedouin
<!--241.png-->
Love Song” and Shelley’s “I arise from dreams
of thee,” are about equally distributed. Most
poets have their early experiments in the reshaping
of forms and themes, but they should
be edited out of representative collections. The
poem is scarcely a creditable assimilation of
the models in question, and does scant justice
to Mr. Woodberry’s later poetry, making the
query more inevitable why he should have left
it in the volume, which is in the main so
finished and ripe a work. Occasionally one
comes upon poems, or passages, which a keener
self-criticism would have eliminated, as the line
from “Taormina,” declaring that</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Front more majestic of sea-mountains nowhere is there uplifted the whole earth through,&mdash;</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>whose legitimate place is in a rhetorical textbook,
as an exercise in redundance. Mr. Woodberry
is occasionally allured by his theme until
the song outruns the motive, but he rarely pads
a line like this; even poetic hyperbole has a
limit.</p>

<p>In picturesque imagery his work is finely
individualized; witness the figurative beauty
of the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The ocean, storming on the rocks,</div>
  <div class="verse">Shepherds not there his wild, wet flocks.</div>

  <div class="verse">The soaring ether nowhere finds</div>
  <div class="verse">An eyrie for the wingéd winds;</div>
  <div class="verse">Nor has yon glittering sky a charm</div>
  <div class="verse">To hive in heaven the starry swarm;</div>
  <div class="verse">And so thy wandering thoughts, my heart,</div>
  <div class="verse">No home shall find; let them depart.</div>

<p>The two sonnets “At Gibraltar” represent,
perhaps, as fine an achievement as distinguishes
Mr. Woodberry’s work. It would, indeed, be
difficult to surpass them in American literature
of to-day in strength, passion, or ideality:</p>

<p>Whether in his travels or in the quiet of his
own contemplation, the emphasis of Mr. Woodberry’s
thought is upon the noble, the essential,
the beautiful. Although not a strongly
creative poet in form, he is a highly cultivated
poet, and hands on the nobler traditions of art;
and if now and then he wraps another’s “singing
robe” about him, it is but an external
vesture, leaving the soul of his thought unchanged.</p>

<h3><a name="Knowles" id="Knowles"></a><abbr title="Eleven">XI</abbr></h3>

<h4>FREDERIC LAWRENCE KNOWLES</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">MR. FREDERIC LAWRENCE
KNOWLES is one of the younger
poets about whose work there is no
veneer. This is not to imply that it lacks finish,
but rather that the foundation is genuine; it reflects
its native grain, and not an overlaid polish.
One feels back of the work the probity and
directness that underlie all soundly conditioned
literature; for while Mr. Knowles has the
poet’s passion for the beauties of the art he
essays, the primary value is always in that to
be conveyed rather than in the medium of
transmission.</p>

<p>This sincerity is at once Mr. Knowles’ distinction
and his danger. He is so manifestly
in earnest that one feels at times in his work
a certain lack of the imaginative leaven which
should lighten the most serious thought; to
put it in a word, there is often an over-strenuous
note in his poetry; but were it put
to a choice between this mood and the honeyed
<!--245.png-->
artificialities to which one is often treated, there
would be no hesitancy in choosing the former,
for</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The poet is not fed on sweets;</div>
  <div class="verse">Daily his own heart he eats,&mdash;</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>not morbidly, but finding within his own spirit
daily manna, and living by this aliment and not
by the mere nectar of things. Everything in life
bestows this manna and daily renews it; and
the poet is he who assimilates and transmutes
it to personal needs until his thought is fed
from his own heart as in Emerson’s couplet.</p>

<p>This is Mr. Knowles’ ideal of growth, evidenced
by the eager interest and open sympathy
with which he seeks from life its elements
of truth, and from experience its developing
properties. It is, of course, an ideal beyond
his present attainment, probably beyond his
ultimate attainment, gauged by absolute standards,
for the “elements of truth” are hardly
to be separated from life by one magnet.
They are variously polarized, and though one
may possess the divining wand that shall disclose
the nature and place of certain of them,
there is no wand polarized for all; but it is the
poet’s part to pass that magnet of truth which
is his by nature over the field of life, that it may
<!--246.png-->
attract therefrom its range of affinities, and this
Mr. Knowles is doing.</p>

<p>Before taking up his later work, however,
we may glance at his matin songs, <cite>On Life’s
Stairway</cite>, which have many indicative notes
worthy of consideration. This volume, that
called forth from John Burroughs, Richard
Henry Stoddard, Joaquin Miller, and others,
such hearty commendation, has an individuality
that makes itself felt. First, perhaps, one notes
its spontaneity and the evident love of song
that is its primal impulse. The fancy is fresh
and sprightly, not having yet thought’s heavier
freight; the optimism is robust, the loyalty to
one’s own time impassioned and absolute, and
the democracy and Americanism distinguishing
it are of the commendable, if somewhat
grandiloquent, type belonging to youthful
patriotism. Another feature of Mr. Knowles’
work, manifest in both volumes, is that its inspiration
is from life rather than nature, which
is refreshing in view of the fact that the reverse
obtains with most of the younger poets. When,
however, he comes to this theme, it is with a
lightness of touch and a pleasant charm of
mood that give to the few poems of this subject
an airy delicacy and an unpremeditated
note, as in these lines:</p>

<p>In his poems upon love, Mr. Knowles touches
some of his truest and surest notes; those in the
second volume have a broader and more sympathetic
appeal, and yet have not lost the confessional
note which alone gives value to the
subject. They are not invariably of a more
inspired touch than are several in the first collection,
such as “Lost Knowledge,” “A Song
for Simplicity,” and “Love’s Prayer;” now and
again they combine some newly minted phrase
<!--250.png-->
flashing with unsullied lustre, with such as
have passed from hand to hand in the dulling
commerce of language; but it is perhaps
too much to demand that all fancies shall be
newly stamped with the die of imagination.
One of Mr. Knowles’ strongest poems from
the group in question is entitled “Love’s
World;” but for greater brevity I shall quote
instead these charming lines which introduce
the collection called <cite>Love Triumphant</cite>:</p>

<p>Of this group, however, it is in the sonnet, “If
Love Were Jester at the Court of Death,” that
Mr. Knowles’ most genuine inspiration has
visited him.</p>

<p>The conception of the sonnet is unique,
and its opening line of epigrammatic force
and suggestiveness:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">If Love were jester at the court of Death,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And Death the king of all, still would I pray,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">“For me the motley and the bauble, yea,</div>
  <div class="verse">Though all be vanity, as the Preacher saith,</div>
  <div class="verse">The mirth of love be mine for one brief breath!”</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Then would I kneel the monarch to obey,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And kiss that pale hand, should it spare or slay;</div>
  <div class="verse">Since I have tasted love, what mattereth!</div>
  <div class="verse">But if, dear God! this heart be dry as sand,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And cold as Charon’s palm holding Hell’s toll,</div>
  <div class="verse">How worse! how worse! Scorch it with sorrow’s brand!</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Haply, though dead to joy, ’t would feel <em>that</em> coal;</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">Than Pilate’s palace and a frozen soul!</div>

<p>Here are originality, strength, and white heat
of feeling, though the sestett is less artistic
than the octave, which holds the creative
beauty of the sonnet.</p>

<!--252.png-->
<p>Of the lyrical poems in the second volume
there are many clear of tone, having not only
a pure, enunciative quality musically, but also
color and picturesqueness, as that beginning:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">With all his purple spoils upon him</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Creeps back the plunderer Sea,</div>

<p>with its succession of pictures such as these:</p>

  <div class="verse">O bandit, with the white-plumed horsemen,</div>

<p>Admirable phrasing is that of “wave-defeated
oars”! But before taking up the more strenuous
side of his work, there is another lyric
rich in melody and emotion,&mdash;a lyric in which
one feels the under-current of passion. It is
named, “A Song of Desire”:</p>

<p>Mr. Knowles is a modern of the moderns,
and his Whitmanesque conviction that “we
tally all antecedents;” that “we are the scald,
the oracle, the monk, and the knight;” that
“we easily include them and more,”&mdash;finds
expression in each of his volumes, in poems
ranging from boyish fustian, at which he would
now smile, to the noble lines of “Veritas” and
other poems in the later work. There are certain
subjects that hold within them percussion
powder ready to explode at the touch of a
thought,&mdash;subjects which, to one’s own peculiar
temperament, seem to be provocative of
a fulminant outburst whenever one collides

<p>One will hardly deny that this is sound
doctrine, as are the stanzas necessarily omitted,
which trace the qualifications of the bard of
to-day. Assuredly one touches the question
of questions when he seeks the cause for the
apparent waning of poetic inspiration in our
own time. There is certainly no wane in the
diffusion of the poetic impulse; but the poet

<p>is hardly being heard at the present hour.
There are voices and voices which proclaim
truths, but the voice that enunciates Truth in
its larger utterance&mdash;as it is spoken, for example,
in the words of Browning&mdash;seems not to
find expression in our day. From this the impression
has come to prevail that Art is choking
virility of utterance, and that a wholly new
order of song must grow from newer needs,&mdash;song
that shall express our national masculinity,
our robust democracy, our enlarged patriotism,
and our sometimes bumptious Americanism;
that labor must have its definite poet, and
the “hymn to the workman’s God” contain
some different note from that hitherto chanted.

<p>These are fine, swinging strophes, proclaiming
the modern ideal from Whitman to Kipling
that “the song that is fit for men” must
have in it some robust timbre, some resonant
fibre, unheard before; that a sturdier race of
bards must arise, “sprung from the toilers at
the bench and plough,”&mdash;that, in fine, the new
America must have a more orotund voice to
sing her needs.</p>

<p>This has a convincing plausibility on the
face of it; but do the facts bear it out,&mdash;are
virility and democracy and modernity the essential
elements of the “song that is fit for
men”? If so, then Whitman, who is the apogee
of the elemental and democratic, or Kipling,
whose tunes blare in one’s ears like the
horns of a band, and whose themes are aggressively
of the day and hour, would be the ideal
types of the new-day poet, and we should find
the sturdy laborer and the common folk in
<!--257.png-->
general coming to these sources for refreshment,
inspiration, and aid in tracing their
dreams; but, on the contrary, Whitman, by a
frequent paradox of letters, is a poet for the
most cultivated and deeply reflective minds.
Only such can understand and embrace his
universality, and, on the poetic side, enjoy his
splendid diction and the wave-like sweep of
his rhythms. His formlessness, which was
reactive that he might come the nearer to the
common heart, is one of the chief barriers that
prevent this contact. The unlettered nature,
more than all others, demands the ordered
symmetry of rhythm as a focus and aid to
thought; it demands elemental beauties as
well as truths, and hence not only is Whitman
ruled out by his own measure, but Kipling
also, for again it needs the broadly cultivated
mind to take at his true and at his relative
value a poet like Kipling. The common mind
might be familiar with some poem of occasion,
the English laborer might be found singing
“Tommy Atkins;” but Kipling’s finer shadings
would escape in the beat of his galloping tunes
and in the touch-and-go of his subjects.</p>

<p>If, then, Kipling, who outmoderns the moderns
in singing what is presumably a song fit for
men, and if Whitman, who is as robustly, democratically
<!--258.png-->
American as a poet can well be, and
trumpeting ever that note,&mdash;if these poets do
not reach the typical man, if they are not the
ones to whom the stalwart laborer comes, or the
busy man of affairs, there must be a need anterior
to that of which they sing; song must
spell something else besides virility, democracy,
achievement. It evidently is not the men who
<em>do</em>, not the men who <em>act</em>, that write “the song of
fact” for the laborer and the great class of our
strong, sincere, common folk. They do not
want the song of fact more than do we; they
have no other dream to trace than have we.
They want the primal things,&mdash;love, hope,
beauty, the transforming ideal; they want the
carbon of their daily experience turned to the
crystal; and for this they go to a poet like
Burns, who spoke the universal tongue, who
took the common ideals and touched them
simply, tenderly, not strenuously, to a new form
at the will of his fancy. You shall find the
boatman or the woodsman knowing his Burns,
often his Shakespeare, for he is quick to grasp
the human element, or his Scott, for he loves
romance, when the strident cry of a Kipling,
or of a modern idealist singing of democracy,
or of the newer needs of the laborer himself,
will be wholly lost on him; and hence this note
<!--259.png-->
that one is meeting so often in the recent poets
seems to me to be a false and superfluous one.</p>

<p>The “song that is fit for men” is <em>any</em> song
that has the essence of truth and beauty in it,
and no other <em>is</em> fit for men, no matter where
sung. We have not evolved a new <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genus homo</i>
by our conquest of arms; our democracy is not
changing human nature; we need virility in
song, as Mr. Knowles has said in the earlier
poem quoted; we need that “cosmic stuff
whence primitive feeling glows,” but we need
beauty and spirituality to shape it. Poetry
must minister first of all to the inner life.
Tennyson and Browning were not concerned
with matters of empire, or the passing issues of
the day; they were occupied with the essential
things,&mdash;things of humanity and of the soul,
that shall outlast empire, democracy, or time.
Heaven forefend that our bards shall spring
from a race</p>

<p>rather let them spring from the very ripest,
richest-natured class of men and women, not
servile to custom, but having the breadth of
vision, the poise, the fine and harmonious
development that flowers from the highest
<!--260.png-->
cultivation, whether in the schools or in life.
It did not emasculate the work of Browning
or Milton or Goethe, nor of our own Lowell,
or many another, that he had the most profound
enrichment that education and traditional
culture could give him. Originality is
not crushed by cultivation, nor will native
impulse go far without it. The need is of a
poet who shall divine the underlying harmonies
of life, who shall stimulate and develop the
higher nature, and disclose the alchemizing
truth that shall transmute the gross ore of
experience into the fine metal of character and
spiritual beauty,&mdash;such a poet as Mr. Knowles
himself may become when his idealism shall
have taken on that inner sight of the mystic
which now he shows so definitely in certain
phases of his work.</p>

<p>He is readier in general to see life’s benign
face than its malign one, even though shapen
by pain and guilt; and this brings us to the
group of poems from his new volume, <cite>Love
Triumphant</cite>, turning upon Sin and Remorse,
and presenting an element of human passion
at once the most provocative of degradation
and the most susceptible of spiritual elevation.</p>

<p>Whitman approached this theme from the
cosmic standpoint as he would approach any of
<!--261.png-->
the universalities of life, not specifically from
the spiritual side, in its destiny-shaping effects.
It is from this side that Mr. Knowles essays
its consideration, presenting chiefly the reactive,
retributive phase of guilt,&mdash;the sudden spiritual
isolation of the soul that has sinned, as if
the golden doors that opened on the world had
transformed to iron bars imprisoning the soul
within its cell of memory. This sense of detachment,
of having unwittingly plucked oneself
from the flowering beauty of life, of being
irrevocably cut off from sap and stem, which is
the first and most palpable phase of guilt,
predominates in several of the poems. To
consider it first, then, the stanzas called “Lost”
may be cited as illustrative:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Night scattered gold-dust in the eyes of Earth,</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The hours climbed high. Peace, where the zenith broods,</div>

<p>Here is strong and vivid imagery, especially in

<p>which is a bold and fine stroke not merely in its
metaphorical phrasing, but as a symbol of human
passions. The entire poem is a vivid piece
of symbolism; it is, however, but one phase
of the subject, and in “One Woman” and
“Sin’s Foliage” one comes again face to face
with the same phase, with that terrible memory-haunted
eidolon, the visage of one’s own defaced
soul. It is in the poem “Betrayed” that
a truer perspective begins to be manifest, of
which one stanza&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">

 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>introduces a truth that strikes deeper than the
mere spell of impulse,&mdash;a truth that suggests
the mystery of election in crime: whether one
<!--263.png-->
is wholly responsible for the choice which in
a moment becomes the pivotal event of his
destiny, or whether what Maeterlinck has
called the “conniving voices that we cherish at
the depths of us” summoned the event, and
impelled him inevitably toward its hazard; and,
further, whether these voices are not often the
commissioned voices, calling one thus to arouse
from the somnolence of his soul. On the
morrow of the hour in which he has</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent2">… fallen from Heav’n to Hell</div>
  <div class="verse">In one mad moment’s fateful spell,</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>and finds himself in the isolation of his own
spirit,&mdash;consciousness will awaken, life will be
perceived, sympathy will be born, and Pain,
with the daily transfiguring face, will companion
him, until in the years he again meet
Love and the other fair shapes of his destiny.
Since no one remains in the hell to which
he has fallen, but by his own choosing, Life
rebukes the Art that leaves this sense of
finality; for the hour of tragedy is rather the
beginning than the end, and often so manifestly
the birth of the soul into spiritual consciousness
that it may well seem that apparent
sin is the mere agency of the higher forces of
the nature, the shock that displaces ignorance
<!--264.png-->
and smug self-complacency and both humanizes
and deifies the soul.</p>

<p>In other poems of the group, however, the
developing power of sin, and the remedial forces
which it evokes for the renewal of the nature,
are dwelt upon, so that the poems are redeemed
at the last from the impression of hopeless
finality which obtained in the earlier ones.</p>

<p>Few of the younger poets have a more vital
and personal conviction of spiritual things than
Mr. Knowles, and its evolution is interesting to
note. There is abundant evidence in his earlier
verse that he was bred after the strictest letter
of the law; but while his faith was “fixed to
form,” it was seeking “centre everywhere,” and
the later volume widens to an encompassing
view worthy the vision of a poet,&mdash;the view
that finds nothing impervious to the irradiation
of spirit. It is variously sung, but most nobly,
perhaps, in the following poem:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="verse">In buds upon some Aaron’s rod</div>

<p>Mr. Knowles has not embraced the diffusive
faith that has no faith to stay it, but is endeavoring
to read the newer meaning into the
older truths, which is the present-day office of
singer and seer. In the matter of personal valor,
of optimistic, intrepid mood, Mr. Knowles’
work is altogether commendable. He awaits
with buoyant cheer what lies beyond the turn
o’ the road. His poem “Fear,” from the
first collection, was widely quoted at the time
because of its heartening tone, and in his new
volume, “A Challenge,” “A Twofold Prayer,”
and many another sounds the same invincible
note. “Laus Mortis” is a hymn to death holding
within it the truer acceptation of that
natural and therefore kindly change:</p>

<p>Mr. Knowles’ work is virile, earnest, individual,
free from affectation or imitation; modern
in spirit, recognizing the significance of to-day,
and its part in the finer realization of to-morrow;
sympathetic in feeling, and spiritual
<!--268.png-->
in vision. Its limitations are such as may be
trusted to time, being chiefly incident to the
earnestness noted above, which now and again
borders on didacticism. Excess of conviction
is, however, a safer equipment for art than a
philosophy already parting with its enthusiasms
by the tempering of life, being more likely to
undergo the shaping of experience without
losing the vital part.</p>

<h4>ALICE BROWN</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">MISS ALICE BROWN has published
but one volume of verse; but we live
in feelings, not in titles on a cover,
and it is possible to prove oneself a poet in one
volume of verse, or in one poem thereof. When
Miss Brown some years ago paid this tribute at
the toll-gate of song by a small volume entitled
<cite>The Road to Castaly</cite>, it created no inconsiderable
comment among lovers of poetry,
and there were not wanting those who saw
in it as definite gifts as Miss Brown possesses
in fiction; but despite the generous recognition
which the collection won, she has not seen fit
to follow it with others, and with the exception
of occasional poems in the magazines, it remains
the sole representation of this phase of her
work. Yet within a range of seventy pages she
has gathered a stronger group of poems than
might be winnowed from several collections of
some of those who cultivate verse more assiduously.
Nor is this to declare that from cover
to cover of her volume the inspired touch is
<!--270.png-->
everywhere manifest; doubtless the seventy
pages would have gained in strength by compression
to fifty. It is, however, to declare
that within this compass there is a true accomplishment,
at which we shall look briefly.</p>

<p>First, then, the work has personality and
magnetism, bringing one at once into sympathetic
interchange with the writer. The feeling
is not insulated by the art, but is imbued
with all the warmth of speech; there are no
“wires” but the live wires of vibrant words,
conducting their current of impulse directly to
the reader. One feels that Miss Brown has
written verse not as a pleasant diversion, nor
yet with painful self-scrutiny, but only when
her nature demanded this form of expression,
and hence the motive shapes the mechanism,
rather than the reverse.</p>

<p>Miss Brown’s poems are not primarily philosophical,
not ethical to the degree of being
moralistic; but they have a subtly pervasive
spirituality, and in certain lyrics, such as
“Hora Christi,” a rare depth of religious emotion.
They are records of moods: of the soul,
of passing life, of the psychic side of death, of
the mutability of love, of ecstatic surrender to
nature, of loyalty to service,&mdash;in short, they
are poems of the intuitions and sympathies,
<!--273.png-->
and warm with personality. Perhaps the most
buoyant note in the book is that in celebration
of the joys of escape from town to
country; from the thrall of paving-stones and
chimney-pots to the indesecrate seclusion of the
pines, where the springy pile of the woodland
carpet gives forth a pungent odor to the tread;
and where, in Miss Brown’s delicate phrase,</p>

<!--274.png-->
<p>Miss Brown’s rapt poems in celebration of
nature range from the impassioned dignity of
her stanzas picturing a “Sunrise on Mansfield
Mountain” to fancies so delicate that
they seem to be caught in gossamer meshes
of song. The poems are somewhat inadaptable
to quotation, as several of the best, such
as “Wood-Longing,” “Pan,” and “Escape,”
are written in stanzas whose exuberant impulse
carries them so far that they may not be excised
midway without destroying a climax. Upon a
first reading of some of these periods they give
one an impression of being over-sustained; but
the imagery is clear, and upon a second reading
one is likely to catch the infection of the lines
and be borne on with them to the reversal of
his first judgment. “Wood-Longing” thrills
with the passion of</p>

<p>“Sunrise on Mansfield Mountain,” written
in fine resonant pentameter, and building up
stanza by stanza to the supreme climax of the

<p>Mr. Archer, in his <cite>Poets of the Younger Generation</cite>,
quotes this poem as the gem of Miss
Brown’s collection; and it certainly is a charming
lyric, but not more so to my thinking than
several of an entirely different nature, which
will also in time’s trial by fire remain the true
coin. It needs a somewhat broader and deeper
term, however, than “charming” to qualify
such poems as “Hora Christi,” “On Pilgrimage,”
“Seaward Bound,” “The Return,” “The
Message,” “The Slanderer,” “Lethe,” and “In
Extremis,” in which life speaks a word charged
with more vital significance. “On Pilgrimage”
(<span class="sc">A. D.</span> 1250) reveals an art that is above
praise. With only the simplest words Miss
Brown has infused into this poem the very
essence of pain, of numb, bewildered hopelessness.
One feels it as a palpable atmosphere:</p>

<p>with its salient advice to the languishing
adorer.</p>

<p>Miss Brown’s small volume is by no means
lacking in variety, either in theme or form; it
is full of spontaneous music, rarely forcing the
note in any lyric inspiration. In the sonnet
she is less at ease: here one feels the effort,
the mechanism; but only four sonnets are included
in the volume, which shows her to be
a true critic. There are certain poems that
might, perhaps, with equal advantage have
been eliminated, such as the over-musical numbers
to Dian and Endymion; but in the main,
Miss Brown has done her own blue-pencilling,
and <cite>The Road to Castaly</cite>, as stated in the
beginning, maintains a fine and even grade of
workmanship.</p>

<p>In such poems as are touched to tenderness
and reverence, half with the sweetness and half
with the pain of life, Miss Brown makes her
truest appeal. The fine ideality, the spiritual
fealty of her nature, as shown in her work,
always relates itself to one on the human side.
It is not the fealty that shames a weaker
nature by its rigid steadfastness, but that in
which one sees his own wavering strife reflected.
Her lines called “The Artisan,”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span>

written since the publication of her volume, are
instinct with such feeling as comment would
profane. One can but feel, with a quick pang
of sympathy, that he, too, makes the appeal:</p>

  <div class="verse">From the defiant passion of my prayer;</div>
  <div class="verse">Yet here they grope on this cold altar stone,</div>
  <div class="verse">Graving the words I think I should make known.</div>
  <div class="verse">Mine eyes are Thine. Yea, let me not forget,</div>
  <div class="verse">Lest with unstaunchèd tears I leave them wet,</div>
  <div class="verse">Dimming their faithful power, till they not see</div>
  <div class="verse">Some small, plain task that might be done for Thee.</div>
  <div class="verse">My feet, that ache for paths of flowery bloom,</div>
  <div class="verse">Halt steadfast in the straitness of this room.</div>
  <div class="verse">Though they may never be on errands sent,</div>
  <div class="verse">Here shall they stay, and wait Thy full content.</div>
  <div class="verse">And my poor heart, that doth so crave for peace,</div>
  <div class="verse">Shall beat until Thou bid its beating cease.</div>
  <div class="verse">So, Thou dear master God, look down and see</div>
  <div class="verse">Whether I do Thy bidding heedfully.</div>

<p>These lines well illustrate the fact that true
emotion is not literary nor self-observant, and
does not cast about for some rare image in
which to enshrine itself. Here is the simplest
Saxon, and wholly without ornament, yet who
could be unconscious of the heart-beat of life
in the words? In her poem, “In Extremis,”
one is moved by the same intensity of feeling
<!--282.png-->
expressed in the litany imploring deliverance
from fear.</p>

<p>Of the more purely devotional poems, “Hora
Christi” is perhaps the most reverent, and instinct
with delicate simplicity. It is a song of
the spirit, interpreting a mood whose springs
are deep in the pain of life, but whose hidden
wells have turned to sweetness and healing. It
is not philosophically penetrative, but a tender,
beautiful song warm with sincerity of feeling:</p>

<p>In glancing over <cite>The Road to Castaly</cite>, one
notes many poems that might perhaps have
represented it better than those chosen, such
as “The Return,” “The Unseen Fellowship,”
“Mariners,” “Forewarned,” and “Seaward
Bound;” but sufficient have been cited to
show the quality of the volume and the sympathetic
touch which Miss Brown possesses.
Her nature poems range from the most exuberant
fancy to a Keats-like richness and ripeness
of phrase; and her miscellaneous verse
from the tender, reverential note of the lyric
last quoted to the trenchant scathing lines of
“The Slanderer.” It is, in brief, such work
as combines feeling and distinction, and leaves
one spiritually farther on his way than it found
him.</p>

<h4>RICHARD BURTON</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">ABOUT a decade ago there came from the
press a demure little book clad soberly
in Quaker garb, and hight gravely and
mysteriously, <cite>Dumb In June</cite>. The title alone
would have piqued one’s curiosity as to the
contents of the volume, but the name of the
author, Richard Burton, was already known
from magazine association with most of the
songs in the newly published collection, and also
as literary editor of the “Hartford Courant,”
whence his well-considered criticisms were
coming to be quoted.</p>

<p>There was, then, a circle of initiates into
whose hands <cite>Dumb In June</cite> soon made its
way, and quite as unerringly, in most cases, to
their hearts, and certain of these will tell you
that <cite>Dumb In June</cite> still represents him most
adequately; that it has a buoyancy and lyric
joy such as less often distinguishes his later
work; and this point is well taken from the
consideration of magnetic touch and disillusioned
<!--285.png-->
fancy; but is it quite reasonable to
demand that “the earth and every common
sight” shall continue to be “apparelled in celestial
light” to the eyes of the poet when the years
have brought the sober coloring to our own?
that Art shall be winged with the glory and
the dream when Life’s wings droop to the dust?
Would it be the truest art that should communicate
only this impulse? Mr. Burton has not
thought so: he has set himself to incorporate,
in the life that he touches, the glory and the
dream; to lift the weight, if ever so little, from
the laden wings, and he uses his gifts to that end.</p>

<p>This is not an ideal that can embody itself
in lightsome, dawn-fresh songs, as those that
came, unsullied of pain, inviolate in hope, from
out his nature-taught years; but it is an ideal
for which one should barter, if need be, the
mere lyric joy of that earlier time. To divine
the dumb emotion, the unexpectant desire, of
the man of the streets, and to become his
interpreter, is a nobler achievement than to
catch in delicate fancies the airiest thoughts of
Pan. The poet who remains merely the voice
of the wood-god, or the voice of the mystic, or
the voice of the scholar dreaming and aloof,
may float a song over the treetops, but it will
not be known at the hearth, which is the final
<!--286.png-->
test. Not to anticipate Mr. Burton’s later
ideal, however, let us return to <cite>Dumb In June</cite>
and go with him upon the way of nature,
unshadowed and elate.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note, in studying the
formative time of many poets, that nature is
the first mistress of their vows, and a less capricious
one than they shall find again; hence
their fealty to her and their ardor of surrender.
Life has not yet come by, and paused to whisper
the one word that shall become the logos
of the soul; truth is still in the cosmos, the
absolute, and one despairs of reducing it to the
relative as he might of detaching a pencil of
light from the rays of the sun. Nature alone
represents the evolved intelligence, the harmony,
the soul of the cosmos, and its ideal
made real in law; where, then, shall one begin
his quest for truth more fittingly than at the
gate of nature, where Beauty is the portress
and Beauty is the guide?</p>

<p>Mr. Burton feels the vitality, the personality,
of objects in the outer world. There is no such
thing in his conception as inert matter; it is all
pulsing with life and sensibility. To him May

<p>and henceforth we picture her as coming
blithely by with flower-filled hands. This
glimpsing of the May is from one of Mr. Burton’s
later songs, “The Quest of Summer,”&mdash;a
poem full of color and atmosphere. After
deploring the spring’s withholding, it thrills
to this note of exultation:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent6">But it came,</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">In a garment of sensitive flame</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">In the west, and a royal blue sky overhead,</div>
  <div class="verse">With exuberant breath and the bloom of all things</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Having wonders and wings,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Being risen elate from the dead.</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Yea, it came with a flush</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Of pied flowers, and a turbulent rush</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Of spring-loosened waters, and an odorous hush</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">At nightfall,&mdash;and then I was glad</div>
  <div class="verse">With the gladness of one who for militant months has been sad.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The very breath of spring is in this; one inhales
it as he would a quickening aroma; it thrills
him with the sensuous delight in the color, the
perfume, the warmth, of the expanding air; and
what delicate feeling for the atmospheric value
of words is that which condenses a May twilight
into “an odorous hush at nightfall.” The
words “odorous hush,” in this connection,
have drawn together by magnetic attraction;
substitute for them their apparent equivalents,
<!--290.png-->
“perfumed silence,” “fragrant quiet,” and the
atmosphere has evaporated as breath from a
glass; but an “odorous hush” conveys the sense
of that suspended hour of a spring twilight
when day pauses as if hearkening, and silence
falls palpably around,&mdash;that spiritual hour when
the flowers offer up their evening sacrifice at
the coming of the dew.</p>

<p>Apropos of the feeling for words and their
niceties of distinction as infusing what we term
atmosphere into description, it may be said in
passing that while Mr. Burton’s sense of these
values which is so keen in his prose does not
always stand him in equal stead in his poetry,
it is seldom lacking in his songs of nature.</p>

<p>One may dip into the out-of-door verse at
random and come away with a picture; witness
this “Meadow Fancy”:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>While the metaphorical idea in these strophes
is not new, they record with freehand strokes
<!--291.png-->
one of those suddenly suggestive moods that
nature assumes, one of the swift similitudes
she flashes before us as with conscious delight.
Mr. Burton’s nature-outlook is all open-air
vision; no office desk looms darkly behind
it, as is sometimes the case in his other verse.
It is the sort of inspiration that descends upon
one when he is afoot with his vision, roaming
afield with beauty. A leaf torn hastily
from a notebook serves to catch the fleeting
spell; magnetism tips the pencil; and ink and
type, those dread non-conductors of impulse,
cannot retard or neutralize its current. This
is, in a word, the charm that rests upon the
little volume, <cite>Dumb In June</cite>, in its various
subjects. It would be idle to assert that it
is as strong work as Mr. Burton has done;
but it is vivid and magnetic, and touched
but lightly with the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">weltschmerz</i> which life is
sure to cast upon maturer work. There is
pain, but it is merely artist-pain, in the ode
that gives its name to the collection.</p>

<p>Among the few love poems in Mr. Burton’s
first volume, “The Awakening” is one of the
truest in feeling; “Values” one of the blithest
and daintiest; “Still Days and Stormy,” reminiscent
of Emily Dickinson in manner, one of
the most delicate, catching in charming phrase
<!--292.png-->
one of the unanalyzed moods of love. The
earlier volume has also a captivating poem
in the lighter vein, that sings itself into the
memory by its lilting rhythm and graceful
rhyme-scheme, as well as by its subject. It
is the story of Shakespeare’s going a-wooing
“Across the Fields to Anne”:</p>

<p><cite>Dumb In June</cite> has many foregleams of the
wider vision which distinguishes Mr. Burton’s
present work, as shown in his sonnet upon the
Christ-head by Angelo, in “Day Laborers,”
and in that noble poem, “Mortis Dignitas,”
imbued with reverence and touched with the
simplicity of the verities. It must be appraised
with the best work of his pen, not only for its
theme, but for the direct and unadorned word

<p>This is a fitting transition to <cite>Lyrics of
Brotherhood</cite>, which, together with his latest
volume, presents the phase of Mr. Burton’s
work most representative of his feeling toward
life. Any poet worthy of the name will come
at last to a vision that only his eyes can see.
Life will rise before him in a different semblance
from that she presents to another; and
if Beauty has lured him on, votary to that he
might not wholly see, Life’s yearning face wears
no disguise, and, once having looked upon it
with seeing eyes, it is an image not to be
effaced. There are many who look and never
see,&mdash;the majority, perhaps. Their eyes are
holden by the shapes that cross the inner
sight, by hope and memory and their own
ideal. They shall see only by one of those
<!--295.png-->
“flashes struck from midnight” of a personal
tragedy&mdash;and often enough we gain our vision
thus.</p>

<p>There is a penetrative insight, that of the
social economist, for example, that may possess
no ray of sympathetic divination. It may probe
to the heart of a condition, correlate causes and
tendencies and divine effects, all from a scientific
motive as professional as the practice of
law, and as keen and cold. One may even be an
avowed philanthropist and never come in sight
of a human soul, as will the poet who looks upon
the individual not as a case to be classified and
tabulated, but as one walking step to step with
him, though more heavily, whom he may reach
out and touch now and then with the quickening
hand of sympathy, and whose load he may
bear bewhiles on the journey.</p>

<p>Such a poet is Mr. Burton, whose nature is
shapen to one image with his fellows. To him
literature is not an entity to be weighed only
in the scales of beauty by the balances of Flaubert;
it is to-day’s and to-morrow’s speech. In
his prose, especially, this directness is marked;
but in his poems one feels rather the inner relation
with their spirit, for the magnetism of
touch is less communicative than in the more
flexible medium of prose. What is communicative,
<!--296.png-->
however, is the feeling that Mr. Burton
is living at the heart of things where the fusion
is taking place that makes us one. <cite>Lyrics of
Brotherhood</cite> is a genuine clasp of hand to hand,
nor is he dismayed by the grime of the hand,
for the primal unities are primal sanctities to
him. Longing, strife, defeat, achievement, are
all interpreted to him of personal emotion, solvent
in personal sympathy.</p>

<p><cite>Lyrics of Brotherhood</cite> opens with a poem
that redeems from odium one opprobrious
symbol as old as time. It is that catch-penny
epithet, “black sheep,” that we bandy about
with such flippancy, tossing it as loose change
in a character appraisal and little recking what
truth-valuation may lie behind it. It is good
to feel that the impulse to redeem this symbol
came to Mr. Burton and wrought so well within
him, for “Black Sheep” is one of his truest inspirations
in feeling and expression:</p>

<p>Throughout Mr. Burton’s work there is a
warm feeling for the simple tendernesses, the
unblazoned heroisms of life; the homely joys,
the homely valors, the unknown consecrations,
the unconfessed aspirations,&mdash;in a word, for
all that songless melody of the common soul
whose note we do not catch in the public clamor.
There is a tendency, however, in his later work
that, from an artistic standpoint, is carried too
far,&mdash;the tendency to analogize. Everything in
life presents an analogy to him who is alert for
it; and the habit of looking for analogies and
<!--298.png-->
symbols and making poems thereon grows upon
one with the fatal facility of punning, upon a
punster. A symbol, or the subtler and more
profound analysis that seeks the causal relation
of dissimilar things, which we term analogy,
must have the magic of revelation; it must flash
upon the mind some similitude unthought or
unguessed. Emerson is the past-master of this
symbolistic magic; they bring him rubies, and
they become to him souls, of</p>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent6">Friends to friends unknown:</div>
  <div class="verse">Tides that should warm each neighboring life</div>
  <div class="verse">Are locked in frozen stone.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>Here is the eye of the revelator, for who, looking
upon rubies, would have seen in them what
Emerson saw, and yet what a truth bides at
the heart of this symbol!</p>

<p>Mr. Burton has several analogies, such as “On
the Line,” “North Light,” and “Black Sheep,”
quoted above, that are excellently wrought;
indeed, it is not so much the manner in which
the analogy is elaborated that one would criticise,
as the frequently too-obvious nature
of it.</p>

<p>The danger to a poet in dropping too often
into analogy is that he will become a singer
of effects, a watcher of manifestations, and forget
<!--299.png-->
to look for the gleam within himself and
make it the light of his seeing. If poetry
become too much a matter of observation, of
report, vitality goes from it; for imagination
is stultified and emotion quenched, and poetry
at its best is a union of imagination and emotion.
Mr. Burton’s poems in the main escape this
indictment, but their danger lies along this line.
His perception of identities is so acute, his
sympathy so catholic, that not only is nothing
human alien to him, but there is nothing in
which he cannot find a theme for poetry.
For illustration, there is an imaginative beauty
in the symbol of the homing bird, but its artistic
value is lost from over-use. Mr. Burton has
some pleasing lines upon it, reaching in the final
couplet a stronger tone, but from the nature of
the case they cannot possess any fresh suggestion;
on the contrary in such lines as “Nostalgia,”
“In The Shadows,” “The First Song,”
“If We Had The Time,” though less poetic
in theme, there is a personal note; one feels
back of them the great weariness, the futile
yearning of life. Some of the elemental emotion
is in them, the personal appeal that is
so much Mr. Burton’s note when he does not
give himself too much to things without. Even
though one use the visible event but as a sign
<!--300.png-->
of the spirit, as the objective husk of the subjective
truth, it is a vision which, if over-indulged,
leads at length away from the living, the creative
passion within. One philosophizes, one
contemplates, but the angel descends less often
to trouble the waters within one’s own being,
and it is, after all, for this movement that one
should chiefly watch.</p>

<p><cite>Message and Melody</cite>, Mr. Burton’s latest collection,
opens with perhaps his strongest and
most representative poem, “The Song of the
Unsuccessful.” It is a poem provocative of
thought, and upon which innumerable queries
follow. Its opening lines utter a heresy
against modern thinking; our friends, the
Christian Scientists and Mental Scientists and
Spiritual Scientists, would at once cross swords
with Mr. Burton and wage valiant conflict over
the initial statement that God has “barred” from
any one the “gifts that are good to hold.” Indeed,
the entire poem would come under their
indictment for the same reason. But something
would be won from the conflict; the stuff
from which thought is made is in the poem.
In the mean time let us have it before we
consider it further. Here are the types marshalled
before us; we recognize them all as
they appear:</p>

an artistic standpoint it is a stronger piece of
work than it would have been had its philosophy
chimed better with modern thinking. The unsuccessful
are speaking; their view-point and not
necessarily the author’s is presented. To have
tacked on a clause additional, with a hint of the
inner laws that govern success, might have
saved the philosophy from impeachment as to
falling back upon Providence; but it would
have been a decidedly false note put into the

<p>who put forth apparently more effort to score
than did many of the victors, but who were
waylaid by some invidious circumstance, or
who failed to “grasp the skirts of happy
chance” as the flying goddess passed them?</p>

<p>Mr. Burton’s poem is too broad to discuss
in the limits of a brief sketch; it would
furnish a text for the sociologist. All the
complexities of modern conditions lie back of
its plaint, which becomes an arraignment. One
<!--304.png-->
feels that if God be not within the shadow, he
should at least have given Responsibility and
Will surer means of keeping watch above their
own. The Omaric figure of the Wheel “busied
with despite” rises before one as a symbol of
this whirling strife where only the strongest
may cling, and where the swift revolving
thing, having thrown the weakest off, makes of
them a cushion for its turning; or, in Omar’s
phrase, “It speeds to grind upon the open
wound.”</p>

<p>This is the apparent fact; but within it as
axle to the Wheel is the law upon which it
rotates, the law of individual choice. Each
was given his supreme gift; his word was
whispered to him; if he failed to hear it, or
heed it, or express it in the predestined way,
the flying Wheel casts him to the void, but the
law is not impeached thereby. Outside this
law, however, as spokes to the Wheel, are the
innumerable radiations of human laws and conditions,
so that one may scarcely obey the primary
command of his nature if he would, and
often loses sight of it as the principle upon
which his destiny is revolving. Mr. Burton’s
poem goes beyond the cold-blooded outlook
upon the unsuccessful as merely those who
are cast from the Wheel, and presents the
<!--305.png-->
truer view that they are by no means always
the incompetents or degenerates:</p>

<p>Why? Let the sociologist or the psychologist
determine; in the mean time we have the
quickened sympathy that follows upon the
poem.</p>

<p><cite>Message and Melody</cite> has a group of songs
turning upon some music theme; of these
“Second Fiddle” is the most notable. “In A
Theatre” discloses a narrative vein and shows
that Mr. Burton has a keen sense of the dramatic
in daily life. He has for some time been
working upon a group of narrative poems with
a prologue connecting them, which are soon to
be issued, and which, judging from the fugitive
examples in his other volumes, will disclose an
interesting phase of his talent.</p>

<p>To leave the impression of Mr. Burton’s
work that is most characteristic,&mdash;the impression
of its tenderness, its sympathy, its emphasis
upon the essential things,&mdash;one can scarcely
do better than to summarize it in his own well-known

<h3><a name="Scollard" id="Scollard"></a><abbr title="Fourteen">XIV</abbr></h3>

<h4>CLINTON SCOLLARD</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">THAT genial and delicate satirist, Miss
Agnes Repplier, laments in one of her
clever essays that our modern poets
incline to dwell upon the sombre side of things,
and hence contribute so little to the cheer of
life. One cannot but wonder what poetry Miss
Repplier has been reading, for our own acquaintance
with the song of to-day has been so much
the opposite that it is difficult on the spur of
the moment to recall any poet of the present
group in America whose work is not in the
main wholesome and heartening and who is
not facing toward the sun. To be sure, there
must be the relief of shade, lest the light glare;
but they who journey to Castaly are in general
cheerful wayfarers, taking gladly the gift of
the hours and rendering the Giver a song, and
among the blithest of them is Clinton Scollard,
to whom life is always smilingly envisaged, and
to whom, whether spring or autumn betide, it
is still the “sweet o’ the year.”</p>
<!--308.png-->
<!--310.png-->
<p>If Mr. Scollard’s way has ever been “through
dolor and dread, over crags and morasses,” he
is too much the optimist to let the fact be
known, or, better still, to recognize it as such;
for we see what our own eyes reflect from
within, and it is certain that Mr. Scollard’s outlook
upon life is governed by the inherent conviction
that her ways are ways of pleasantness
and all her paths are peace. Possibly this
conviction would have more value to the less
assured nature if the testimony of its winning
were set down as a strength-giving force by the
way, as we incline in daily life to undervalue
the amiability and cheer which are matters of
birthright rather than of overcoming; but this is
a standard narrow in itself and wide of the issue
at stake, which is so much cheer <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</i>, whether
the fortunate dower of nature, or the alchemic
result of experience; nor may one draw too
definite a line between the temperamental gift
and the spiritual acquisition, especially when
the psychology of literature furnishes the only
data. It is sufficient to note the result in the
work, and its bearing upon the art which shapes
it. To Mr. Scollard, then, “Life’s enchanted
cup” not only “sparkles at the brim;” but
when he lifts it to his lips a rainbow arches in
its depths, and he has communicated to his
<!--311.png-->
song the flash of sunshine and color sparkling
in the clearness of his own draught of life.</p>

<p>Mr. Scollard is almost wholly an objective
poet, and by method a painter. His palette is
ever ready for the picture furnished him at
every turn, and hence his several volumes
relating to the Orient, <cite>Lutes of Morn</cite>, <cite>Lyrics
of the Dawn</cite>, <cite>Songs of Sunrise Lands</cite>, etc.,
are perhaps truer standards by which to measure
his work than any other, illustrating as they
do the pictorial side of his talent. Every object
in the Orient is a picture with its individual
color and atmosphere, but Mr. Scollard does
not merely offer us a sketch in color; the outwardly
picturesque is made to interpret a
phase of life, and the spiritual contrasts in this
land&mdash;where one religion or philosophy succeeds
another, bringing with it another civilization
and leaving desolate the ancient shrines&mdash;are
indicated with vivid phrase, as in these

<p>The final line of these stanzas may offer a
metrical stumbling-block until one catches the
sweep of the rhythm and falls in note with the
cæsural pause after the word “tomb.” Mr.
Scollard is nothing if not lyrical, and it would
be easier for the traditional camel to go
through the eye of a needle than for a captious
critic to discover a metrical falsity in his tuneful
song.</p>

<p>It is difficult to choose from the several volumes
portraying Oriental life, such poems as
shall best represent it, since in any direction
we shall find a picture full of color and of
strange new charm: the white mosques and
minarets; the gardens of citron and pomegranate;
the bazaars, with their rare fabrics and
curios; the pilgrims, dozing in the shade of
the temples; the Bedouins, riding in from the
desert; the women carrying from the springs
their water-jars. We shall hear the sunrise
cry of the muezzin from the minarets; the
zither and lute in the gardens at evening; the
jargon of tongues in booth and market-place;
the philosopher expounding the Koran; the
lover singing the songs of Araby. The dramatic
<!--314.png-->
life of that impulsive, passionate people
will be seen in such poems as the “Dancing
of Suleima,” “At the Tomb of Abel,” and
“Yousef and Melhem,” and the philosophical
side in many a poem translating the precepts
of the Koran into action; but it is, after all,
for the picture in which all this is set that one
comes with chief pleasure to these songs. Not
only the human element of that strangely fascinating
life is incorporated in them, but all
the phenomena of nature in its swift-changing
moods pass in review before one’s eyes, particularly
of the swift transitions of the desert
sun, stayed by no detaining cloud, and followed
by the immediate gloom of night. The graphic

<p>In <cite>The Lutes of Morn</cite> there are two sonnets&mdash;though
lyrics in effect, so does the song

<p>Mr. Scollard’s musical and finely descriptive
poem, “As I Came Down From Lebanon,”
has become a favorite with the readers of his
verse; but while it has great charm, it is not as
strong a piece of work as are many other of
the Oriental poems, contained in his later
volumes, <cite>The Lutes of Morn</cite> and <cite>Lyrics of the

<p>Of the lighter notes, upon love and kindred
themes, Mr. Scollard has many in his poems
of the Orient; “The Song of the Nargileh” is
of especial charm, but unfortunately too long to
quote. Very graceful, too, is the “Twilight
Song” with one of Mr. Scollard’s graphic beginnings,
but one quaint bit from <cite>The Lutes
of Morn</cite> is so characteristic as showing Oriental
felicity of speech that while merely a
jotting in song, and less important in an artistic
sense than many others touching upon the
theme of love, I cannot refrain from citing it
instead: it is called “Greetings&mdash;Cairo.”</p>

<p>The Oriental poems cover not only a varied
range of subject, but pass in review nearly
every important city and shrine in the length
and breadth of that storied land, making poetical
footnotes to one’s history and filling his
memory with pictures.</p>

<p>The second source of Mr. Scollard’s inspiration,
doubtless the first in point of time, is his
delight in nature. Here, too, the objective side
predominates. He is footfaring, with every
sense alert to see, to hear, and to enjoy; he slips
the world of men as a leash and becomes the fetterless
comrade of the vagrant things of earth.
He stops to do no philosophizing by the way,&mdash;the
analogies, the laws, the evolving purposes
of nature, are rarely touched upon in his verse;
nor is he one of the poet-naturalists, intent to
observe and record with infinite fidelity the
fact, with its mystic spirit of beauty. He finds
in the obvious side of nature such glamour and
<!--319.png-->
magic as suffice for inspiration and delight;
and it is this side which enthralls him almost
wholly. In other words, his nature vision is
rather outlook than insight, though always
sympathetic in fancy and delicate in touch.
He seems to see only the gladness in the
season’s phases, and greets white-shrouded
winter with all the ardor that he would bestow
upon flower-decked June.</p>

<p>He has one volume entitled <cite>Footfarings</cite>,
written partly in prose and partly in verse,&mdash;a
book abrim with morning joy, and bringing with
it the aroma of wood-flowers and the minstrelsy
of birds. The prose predominates, and is worthy
the pen of a poet: its imaginative grace, its
enthusiasm, and its quaint and delicate fancy
impart to it all the flavor of poetry while adhering
to a crisp and racy style. Each chapter
is prefaced by a keynote of verse, such as that
which conducts one to the haunt of the trillium,
where</p>

<p>Were it within the province of this study, I
should like to quote some of Mr. Scollard’s
prose from a “Woodland Walk,” “A Search
for the Lady’s Slipper,” or many another picturesque
chapter. One loses thought of print,
and is for the nonce following his errant fancy
through meadow and coppice to the heart of
the spicy fir-woods, picking his way over the
forest brooks, from stone to stone; following
the alluring skid-roads, latticed by new growths
on either side and arched above by interlacing
green; penetrating into the tamarack thickets
at the lure of the hermit-thrush, that spirit-voice
of song; resting on a springy bed of
moss and fern,&mdash;becoming, in short, wayfellow
of desire, and thrall but to his will. Mr. Scollard
has also published within the past year a
book of nature verse called <cite>The Lyric Bough</cite>,
which contains some of his best work in this
way; one of its livelier fancies is that of “The
Wind”:</p>

<p>Balladry furnishes the third source of Mr.
Scollard’s singing impulse. The Oriental
poems have somewhat of this phase of his work,
though more especially inclining to the narrative
style; and the epic poem “Skenandoa,”
while written in a story-lyric, shows the ballad-making
qualities, which in their true note had
been heard earlier in “Taillefer the Trouvère,”
and have been heard more definitely in <cite>Ballads
of Valor and Victory</cite>, recently written in collaboration
with Mr. Wallace Rice, and reciting
the heroisms and adventures of soldier, sailor,
and explorer from Drake to Dewey.</p>

<p>Ballad-writing is an art calling for distinct
gifts. The dramatic element must predominate.
The story first&mdash;and if this be
colorless, there is no true ballad; the verse
next&mdash;and if this be flaccid, or if it swing to
the other extreme and become too strained and
tense, there is no true ballad; for the essence
of ballad-writing is in the freedom of the movement,
the swing and verve with which one
<!--323.png-->
recounts a picturesque story. Mr. Scollard’s
contributions to the volume are sung with spontaneity
and with a virile note, and in the matter
of characterization, fixing the personality of
the hero before the mind, the work is especially
strong; witness “Riding With Kilpatrick;”
“Wayne at Stony Point;” “Montgomery at
Quebec;” the picture of Thomas Macdonough
at the Battle of Plattsburg Bay, or in more
recent times of “Private Blair of the Regulars,”
the modern Sidney, who, dying, gave the last
draught of his canteen to his wounded fellows.</p>

<p>“The White November” and “The Eve of
Bunker Hill” are among the best of the ballads.
The former brings with it a well-known note,
but one newly bedight with brave phrase; indeed,
all the celebrated ballad measures appear
in these song stories, but well individualized in
diction and dramatic mood. They differ of
course in the degree of these qualities; some
have too slight an incident to chronicle; some
might with better effect have been omitted,
particularly “War in April,” by Mr. Rice;
but for this he atones by “The Minute-Men
of Northboro” and other vigorous contributions
to the collection. The ballads have the
merit of structural compactness. While the
necessary portrayal of the incident renders
<!--324.png-->
many of the best of them too long to quote,
there are, in Mr. Scollard’s contribution to
the book, few superfluous stanzas; each plays
its essential part in the development of the
story. They may not, then, be quoted without
their full complement of strophes, which debars
us from citing the “White November,” “Wayne
at Stony Point,” and others mentioned as most
representative; but here is the tale of “Riding
With Kilpatrick,” not more valiant than many
of the others, but celebrating a picturesque
figure. There are certain reminiscent notes of
“How They Brought the Good News from
Ghent to Aix” in this galloping anapestic measure;
and its graphic opening line calls to mind
that instantaneous picture, “At Aershot, up
leaped of a sudden the sun.”</p>

<p>The Lochinvar key is also struck in the description
of Kilpatrick. Mr. Scollard sounds
a less sanguinary note in most of the ballads,
as that of “The Troopers” or “King Philip’s
Last Stand.”</p>

<p>“On the Eve of Bunker Hill,” while recording
no thrilling story, has a note of pensive
beauty in its quiet description of the preparation
for battle before that memorable day, and
of the prayer offered in the presence of the
soldiers, “ranged a-row” in the open night.

<p>In the lyrical narrative poem, such as
“Guiraut, the Troubadour,” Mr. Scollard has
one of his most characteristic vehicles. The
adventures of the singer who sought a maid in
Carcassonne are, no doubt, romantically enhanced
by association of the name with that
of the hapless one who “had not been to Carcassonne;”
but it is certain that one follows
the troubadour in his “russet raimentry,” drawn
by his charm as</p>

<p>but we may not follow his propitious fortunes,
glimpsed but to show the manner of their telling.
The parenthetical lines, recurring in each
stanza, impart a peculiar charm to the recital,
<!--328.png-->
but the diction and phrasing, while pleasant
and in harmony, have no especial distinction
in themselves, and this illustrates a frequent
characteristic of Mr. Scollard’s work that the
melody often carries the charm rather than the
expression or basic theme. He is primarily a
singer, he has the “lute in tune,” and the song
is so spontaneous as sometimes to outsing
the motive. There is always a felicitous, and
often unique, turn of phrase and a most imaginative
fancy, but one feels in a good deal of
the work a lack of acid; it is too bland to bite as
deeply as it ought. Just a bit sharper tang is
needful.</p>

<p>The message should also inform more vitally
the melody, wedding more subtly the outer and
inner grace. A poet is a teacher, whether he
will or no, and the heart should be the vital textbook
of his expounding. It is because of their
deeper rooting in life, though a life foreign to us,
that the Oriental poems of Mr. Scollard have
often greater vitality than the Occidental ones,
whose inspiration is found chiefly in nature.
His ballads show that he has a sympathetic
insight into character and a knowledge of
human motive that would, if infused more
widely through his work, give to it a warmth
of personal appeal and a subjectivity which in
<!--329.png-->
many of its phases it now lacks. The golden
thread of Joy is woven so constantly into
the web of his song that those whose woof is
crossed with the hempen thread of Pain are
likely to feel that he has no word for them, no
hint as to the subtle transformation by which
the hempen thread may merge into the gold,
when the finished fabric hurtles from the
loom. In other words, Mr. Scollard’s work
is too objective to carry with it the spiritual
meaning that it would if ingrained more
deeply in the hidden life of the soul. Along
this line lies its finer development: not that
it shall lose a jot of its cheer, but that it shall
constantly inform it with a richer and deeper
meaning.</p>

<h4>MARY MCNEIL FENOLLOSA</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">TO be a poet of the East, one must be
a painter, using words as a colorist uses
pigment. His poem must be a picture
wherein form and detail are subjected to
the values of tone and atmosphere; like the
dawn-crest of Fujiyama it must glow, it must
dazzle with tints and light. To convert the
pen into an artist’s brush, the vocabulary into
a palette, is an end not to be gained by striving;
it is a talent <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i>, a temperamental color, a
temperamental art.</p>

<p>So vividly is this shown in the work of Mrs.
Mary McNeil Fenollosa that whereas in her
Eastern poems she is every whit the artist, in
her Western, her Occidental poems, she is without
special distinction. Certain of her Western
poems have a conventional, mechanical tone,
while those of the East are abrim with vitality
and impulse. They were not “reared by wan
degrees;” the craftsman did not fashion them;
and although varying in charm, there are few
that lack the Eastern spirit.</p>

<!--331.png-->
<p>Mrs. Fenollosa’s bit of the Orient is Japan,
where nature is ever coquetting,&mdash;laughing in
the cherry, sighing in the lotos. Nature in the
Orient is invested with a personality foreign to
Western countries, a personality reminiscent of
the gods. Then, too, nature is given a more
prominent place in the poetry of the East than
is love, or any of the subjects, so infinite in
variety, which engross a Western singer; and
it happens that Mrs. Fenollosa, catching this
spirit during her life in Japan, gives us chiefly
nature poems in her Eastern collection. With
artist-strokes where each is sure, she flashes
this picture before us:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The day unfolds like a lotos-bloom,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Pink at the tip, and gold at the core,</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">That lave night’s shore;</div>

  <div class="verse">The ineffable pink of a lotos leaf.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>One great charm of the imagery in Mrs.
Fenollosa’s Japanese poems is its subtlety of
suggestion. The imagination has play; something
is left for the fancy of the reader, which
can scarcely be said of some of the highly
<!--332.png-->
wrought verse of our own country. The
first lyric in the collection hints of a score
of things beyond its eight-line scope:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="verse">O let me die a singing!</div>

<p>“To-day my soul’s a dragon-fly,”&mdash;a wingéd

and may have my will.</p>

<p>But these Japanese songs have not wholly
the lighter melody; there are those that sing of
the devastation of the rice-fields after the floods,
a grim and tragic picture; and there are interpretations
of the dreams of the great bronze
Buddha, looking with sad, inscrutable eyes
upon the pilgrims who, with the recurrent
seasons, come creeping to his feet like insects
from the mould; and there is a story of “The
Path of Prayer,”&mdash;a Japanese superstition so
human that one is glad of a religion where
sentiment overtops reason. It pictures one
<!--335.png-->
walking at evening under gnarled old pines
until he chances upon a hidden path leading
through a hundred gates that keep a sacred
way; and as he passes he is amazed to see
along the route, springing as if from the earth,
fluttering white papers, tied</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that Mrs. Fenollosa
gives us so little of the religious or mystical
in Japanese thought, since no country is richer
in material of the sort, and especially as the
isolated poems and passages in which she
touches upon it are all so interpretative. She
has one poem, a petition of old people at a
temple, that strikes deep root both in pathos
and philosophy. Perhaps the Japanese excel
all other peoples in the reverence paid to age,
and yet no excess of consideration can supplant
<!--336.png-->
the melancholy of that time. The second
stanza of Mrs. Fenollosa’s poem expresses
the aloofness of the old,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

 <div class="stanza">

  <div class="verse">Now the strong ones comb the grain;</div>
  <div class="verse">Once we laughed there in the rain,</div>
  <div class="verse">Stooping low in sun and cold</div>

</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>And the last stanza is imbued with the
Buddhistic resignation, the desire to pass, to
be reabsorbed, reinvested, reborn. It is philosophical
after the Karmic law, and beautiful in
spirit even to a Western mind:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

oneself, the outworn, the material, the inefficacious,
die, and give place to the new.</p>

<p>the young eternal self, that, having fulfilled the
conditions of Karma in its present embodiment

<p>Mrs. Fenollosa’s gift is chiefly lyrical, although

 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>So true in color and vision are Mrs. Fenollosa’s
lyrics that one cannot understand how
in a sonnet she can be guilty of so mixed
a metaphor as this describing a “Morning On
Fujisan”:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Through powdered mist of dawn-lit pearl and rose</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">There lifts one lotos-peak of cleaving white,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">The swan-like rhapsody of dying night,</div>
  <div class="verse">Which, softly soaring through the ether, blows</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">To hang there breathless….</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<!--339.png-->
<p>The first two lines are unimpeachable, but
when the “lotos-peak” is amplified into a
“swan-like rhapsody,” one is swept quite
away from his bearings. It is but an illustration
of the effort that often goes to the
building of a sonnet and renders forced and
inept what was designed to be artistic. Mrs.
Fenollosa’s sonnets, however, do not often
violate congruity, for while the sonnet is by
no means her representative form, she handles
it with as much ease as do most of the modern
singers, and occasionally one comes upon her
most characteristic lines in this compass; but
it is true of the sonnet form in general, except
in the hands of a thorough artist, that the
mechanism is too obvious and obscures the
theme.</p>

<p>To know Mrs. Fenollosa at her best one
must read “Miyoko San,” “Full Moon Over
Sumidagawa,” “An Eastern Cry,” “Exiled,”
and this song “To a Japanese Nightingale,”
full of mystic, wistful beauty, of suggestive
spiritual grace. How delicate is its fashioning,
and yet how it defines a picture, silhouettes
it against the Orient night!</p>

<h4>RIDGELY TORRENCE</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">MR. RIDGELY TORRENCE, whose
poetic drama, <cite>El Dorado</cite>, brought
him generous recognition, gave earlier
hostages to fame in the shape of a small volume
with the caption, <cite>The House of a Hundred
Lights</cite>, and gravely subtitled, “A Psalm of
Experience after Reading a Couplet of Bidpai.”</p>

<p>Into this little book were packed some
charming whimsicalities, together with some
graver thoughts&mdash;though not too grave&mdash;and
some fancies full tender. It had, however,
sufficient resemblance to Omar Khayyám to
bring it under a Philistine indictment, though
its point of view was in reality very different.
It was a clever bit of ruminating upon the
Where and How and Why and Whence, without
attempting to arrive at these mysteries, but
rather to laugh at those who did. Mr. Torrence
is so artistic as to know that only the
masters may go upon the road in search of the
Secret, and that the average wayfarer may not
<!--342.png-->
hope to overtake it, but rather to suggest it by
a hint now and then. The philosophy of <cite>The
House of a Hundred Lights</cite> is in the main of
the jocular sort; and Bidpai of indefinite
memory may well chuckle to himself in some
remote celestial corner that any couplet of his
should have been so potent as to produce it.</p>

<p>Mr. Torrence has not, that I can see, filched
the fire from Omar’s altar to kindle his hundred
lights; this, for illustration, is pure whimsicality,
not fatalistic philosophy, as a similar
thought would be in Omar:</p>

<p>Mr. Torrence’s quatrains penetrate into the
nebulous dreams of youth, or rather, interpret
them, since <cite>The House of a Hundred Lights</cite>
was reared in that charméd air, and carry
one through the realm of rainbows to the
land of the gray light, to which every pilgrim
comes anon. Love receives its toll, the
costliest and most precious as youth fares on;
and Mr. Torrence proves himself a poet in his
picture of this tribute-giving at the road-house
of Love. Not only the visioning, but the
lucidity of the words, and their soft consonance,
prove him sensitive to the values of
cadence and simplicity:</p>

<p>This is a deftly fashioned lyric, rather than
a stanza conjoined to others, though, for
that matter, the thread of conjunction in the
poem is slight; almost any of the quatrains
might be detached without loss of value save
in atmosphere, as they are arranged with a
certain logical view and grow a bit more
serious as they progress. We spoke, for instance,
of the path of youth leading to the
grayer light, and incidentally that Youth acquaints
himself with pain as a wayfellow:</p>

<p>No one will deny an individual grace of touch
upon these strings. The artistic value of the
quatrains is unequal; they would bear weeding;
and there is a hint of spent impulse in
the latter part of the volume, though it may
be only by virtue of the grouping that the
cleverer stanzas chance to be massed toward
the front, as they were probably not written
in the order in which they appear. Here
and there in the latter part of the volume
one comes upon some of Mr. Torrence’s most
unique fancies; and, too, if they do not always
give one the same pleasurable surprise, they
are more thoughtful and the verities are in
them. Indeed, Mr. Torrence’s “Psalm of Experience”
is not altogether born of a happy
<!--348.png-->
<em>insouciance</em>; look a bit more closely and you
penetrate the mask, and a face looks out at
you, like to your own face, questioning and
uncertain. We should be glad to quote more
of Mr. Torrence’s quatrains, but must look at
<cite>El Dorado</cite>, his more mature work, which won so
kindly a reception from the critics and public.</p>

<p>It would be idle to assert that <cite>El Dorado</cite> is
a great achievement, but it is a fine achievement,
and notably so as a first incursion into
a field beset with snares for the unwary. Into
some of these Mr. Torrence has fallen, but the
majority of them he has avoided and has proven
his right to fare upon the way he has elected.</p>

<p>As to plot, one may say that <cite>El Dorado</cite> is a
moving tale, full of incident and action, and
sharply defining the characters before the
mind. The action is focused to a definite point
in each scene, making an effective climax, and
in the subtler shading of the story, where Perth,
the released prisoner, mistaking the love of
Beatrix d’Estrada for the young officer of the
expedition, thinks it a requital of his own, Mr.
Torrence has shown himself sensitive to the
effects that are psychological rather than objective;
and, indeed, in this quality, as evinced
throughout the drama in the character of Perth,
the essence of Mr. Torrence’s art consists.</p>

<!--349.png-->
<p>It is more or less an easy artifice for the
dramatist to reduce his hero to the verge of
despair just as his heroine is conveniently near
to save him from leaping over a precipice; but
artifice becomes art when the impalpable emotions
of a nature lost almost to its own consciousness
begin to be called from diffusion and
given direction and meaning. While the characterization
of Perth is not altogether free from
strained sentiment, one recognizes in it a higher
achievement than went to the making of the
more spectacular crises of the play. The dramatic
materials of <cite>El Dorado</cite> are in the main
skilfully handled, and there is logical congruity
in the situations as they evolve, assuming
the premise of the plot. As an acting play,
however, it would require the further introduction
of women characters, Beatrix sustaining
alone, in its present cast, the feminine element
of the drama.</p>

<p>As to the play as literature, as poetry, there
is much to commend, and somewhat to deplore.
If it remain as literature, it must contain elements
that transcend those of its action; if a
well-developed plot were literature, then many
productions of the stage that are purely ephemeral
would take their place as works of art.
Between the dramatic and the theatrical there
<!--350.png-->
is a nice distinction, and only an artist may
wholly avoid the pitfalls of the latter. Mr.
Torrence’s drama seems to me to blend the
two qualities. For illustration the following
outpouring of Coronado, when he returns for
a last hour with Beatrix, then disguising to
follow his army, and finds her faithless to
the tryst, is purely melodramatic. The Friar
Ubeda reminds him that the trumpets call
him, whereupon Coronado exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

  <div class="verse">It is no call, but rather do their sounds</div>
  <div class="verse">Lash me like brazen whips away from her.</div>

  <div class="verse">They drive me with two words, Duty and Death.</div>
  <div class="verse">These are the things that I can only find</div>
  <div class="verse">Outside her arms.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>In the same scene, however, occurs this fine
passage, compact of hopelessness, and having
in it the whole heart-history of Perth, who
speaks it. He is urged by the friar to hasten
that they may join the expedition as it passes
the walls:</p>

  <div class="verse indent4">I need not hasten; it will come to me.</div>

 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<!--351.png-->
<p>This passage recalls another memorably fine,&mdash;that
in which Perth upon his release would
return to his dungeon, being oppressed by the
light:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">I seem to have to bear the sky’s whole arch,</div>
  <div class="verse">Like Atlas, on my shoulders.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>This is divining a sensation with subtle sympathy.
But to return to the consideration of
the literature of Mr. Torrence’s drama from the
standpoint of his characters. Beatrix is a
natural, elemental type of girl, untroubled by
subtleties. Impulse and will are one in her
understanding, and she counts it no shame to
follow where they lead. The love that exists
between herself and Coronado discloses no
great emotional features, no complexities; but
it is not strained nor unnatural, and in the
scene where Beatrix discloses her identity to
Coronado, as he in desperation at the failure of
the quest for <cite>El Dorado</cite> is about to throw himself
over the cliff,&mdash;while the situation itself
has elements of melodrama, the dialogue is
wholly free from it, and indeed contains some
of the truest poetry in the play. Coronado,
with distraught fancy, thinks it the spirit of
Beatrix by whom he is delivered, and fears to
approach her lest he dissolve the wraith, whereupon
<!--352.png-->
Beatrix, among other reassurances, speaks
these lovely lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Have the snow-textured arms of dreams these pulses?</div>
  <div class="verse">Has the pale spirit of sleep a mouth like this?</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>The counter-passion of Mr. Torrence’s drama,
in which its tragedy lies, the passion of
Perth for Beatrix, is so manifestly foredoomed
on the side of sentiment that one looks upon
it purely from a psychological standpoint, but
from that standpoint it is handled so skilfully
that the dramatic feeling of the play centres
chiefly in this character. The Friar Ubeda is
also strongly drawn, and one of the motive
forces of the drama. It is he who reveals to
Perth that he has a son born after his incarceration
who is none other than the young leader
of the expedition, Don Francis Coronado, although
his identity is not revealed by the priest,
and only the clew given that on his hand is
branded a crucifix, as a foolish penance for
some boyhood sin. Many of the finest passages
of the play are spoken between Perth and
Ubeda.</p>

<p>The temptation to Shakespearize into which
nearly all young dramatists fall, Mr. Torrence
has wholly avoided, nor has his verse any of
the grandiloquent strain that often mars dramatic
<!--353.png-->
poetry. It is at times over-sustained,
but is flexible and holds in the main to simplicity
of effect. Such a passage as the following
shows it in its finest quality. Here
are feeling, consistent beauty, and dignity of
word. The lines are spoken by Perth in
reply to Coronado’s parting injunction to remember
that the Font is there, pointing in
the direction of their quest:</p>

<p>are subtly typical of the fear in all joy, the
trembling dread to grasp, lest it elude us.
That, too, is a fine passage in which Coronado
replies to Perth, who seeks to cheer him with
thought of the Water of all Dreams:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Ah, that poor phantom Source! I never sought it.</div>
  <div class="verse">I have found the thing called Youth too deadly bitter</div>
  <div class="verse">To grasp at further tasting.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>“The thing called Youth” is often “deadly
bitter;” and Mr. Torrence has well suggested it
in the revulsion from hope to despair which
follows upon the knowledge that El Dorado is
but a land of Dead-Sea fruit. The atmosphere
with which Mr. Torrence has invested the
scene where all are waiting for the dawn to
lift and reveal the valley of their desire is
charged with mystery and portent; one becomes
a tense, breathless member of the group upon
the cliff, and not a spectator.</p>

<!--355.png-->
<p>Mr. Torrence is occasionally led into temptation,
artistically speaking, by the seduction of
his imagination, and is carried a bit beyond the
point of discretion, as in this passage taken from
the scene where the expedition awaits the dawn
on the morning when its dream is expected to
be realized. Perth and Coronado are looking
to the mist to lift. Perth speaks:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent4">And now in that far edge, as though a seed</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">Were sown, there is a hint of budding gray,</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">A bud not wholly innocent of night,</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">And yet a color.</div>

  <div class="verse"><span class="sc">Cor.</span><span class="ss" style="width:1em"> </span>But see, it dies!</div>

  <div class="verse"><span class="sc">Perth.</span> Yet now it blooms again,</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">Whiter, and with a rumor of hidden trumpets.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Buds in the common day do not usually
bloom with a “rumor of hidden trumpets.”
In the same scene Coronado asks:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent4"><span class="ss" style="width:8em"> </span>Can you not see</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">The gem which is the mother of all dawn?</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="sc">Perth.</span> There is some gleam.</div>
  <div class="verse"><span class="sc">Cor.</span><span class="ss" style="width:10em"> </span>It waits one moment yet</div>
  <div class="verse indent4">Before it thunders upon our blinded sight!</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>It is at least a new conception that <em>gems</em> should
<em>thunder</em> upon one’s <em>blinded sight</em>! In another
scene Mr. Torrence has the “devouring sun”
deepen its “wormlike course” to the world’s
edge. Again, his heroine’s mouth is a little
<!--356.png-->
tremulous “from all the troubled violets in
her veins.” We are a bit uncertain, too, as to
the significance of a “throne-galled night;”
but these are, after all, minor matters when
weighed with the prevailing grace and beauty
of Mr. Torrence’s lines.</p>

<p>The last act of <cite>El Dorado</cite> has to my mind
less of strength and beauty than its predecessors,
and dramatically one may question
its conception and construction. In a general
study of Mr. Torrence’s plot it seemed
that the situations were all developed to the
best advantage, but an exception must, I think,
be made in regard to the last act. One of the
vital requisites of drama is that the suspense
of the action shall hold to the end; there may
be minor <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouements</i>, but the plot must not
be so constructed that the element of mystery
shall have been eliminated ere the close, and
this is exactly what has been done in <cite>El
Dorado</cite>. The two great scenes have already
taken place: <cite>El Dorado</cite> has been proven a myth,
and Beatrix has been united to her lover; there
remains but one thread to unravel, the love of
Perth for Beatrix; and of that the audience has
already the full knowledge and clew, having
seen her rejoined to her lover. The only motive
of the last act is that the audience may see the
<!--357.png-->
effect upon Perth when the revelation of his
loss is made to him; and it is more than a
question whether a scene depending so entirely
upon the psychology of the situation could hold
as a climax to the play.</p>

<p>There is a revelation, however, logically
demanded by the premises of the plot, in
expectation of which the interest is held, and
in whose nonfulfilment I cannot but think that
Mr. Torrence has lost the opportunity for the
most humanly true and effective climax of his
play,&mdash;the disclosure to Coronado of his parentage.
Ubeda, earlier in the drama, has enjoined
Perth not to reveal his identity to his
son, lest it injure his public career; but in the
hour when the supreme loss has come, when
Beatrix, as the wife of Coronado, rejoins the
homeward detachment of Perth and his friend,
and the mortal stroke has fallen,&mdash;then Ubeda
should have declared the relationship and
placed to Perth’s lips ere he died the one
draught that would not “shudder into mist”
ere he had drained it,&mdash;the draught of love
from the heart of his child. The bird of hope
and light should hover just above the darkest
tragedy,&mdash;should brood above it with healing
in its wings. This is partially realized in the
lines in which Mr. Torrence has chosen to veil,
<!--358.png-->
and yet hint, the relationship which Coronado
does not understand:</p>

<h4>GERTRUDE HALL</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">MISS GERTRUDE HALL is a poet
of the intimate mood, the personal
touch, one who writes for herself
primarily, and not for others. One fancies
that verses such as these were penned in
musing, introspective moments in the form in
which they flitted through the mind, and were
indesecrate of further touch. They are as
words warm upon the lips, putting one in
magnetic <em>rapport</em> with a speaker; and their
defects, as well as distinctions, are such as
spring from this spontaneity. Frequently a
change of word or line, readily suggested to
the reader, would have made technically perfect
what now bears a flaw; but these lapses are
neither so marked nor so frequent as to detract
from the prevailing grace of the verse, and but
serve to illustrate the point in question,&mdash;their
unpremeditated note and freedom from posing.</p>

<p>One is not so much arrested by the inevitable
image and word in these lyrics of the
<!--360.png-->
<cite>Age of Fairygold</cite>, as by the feeling, the mood,
that pervades them. It is not a buoyant mood,
nor yet a sombre one, but rather the expression
of a varied impulse, a melody of many stops,
such as one might play for himself at evening,
wandering from theme to theme. The poems
convey the impression of coming in touch with
a personality rather than a book, the veil between
the author and reader being impalpable;
and this, their most obvious distinction, is a
quality in which many poets of the present day
are lacking, either from a mistaken delicacy in
regarding their own inner life as an isolated
mood not of import to others, or in robbing
it of personality and warmth by technical
elaboration.</p>

<p>One may confide to the world by means of
art what he would not reveal to his closest
friend, and yet keep inviolate his spiritual selfhood;
but to withhold this disclosure, to become
but a poet of externals, is to abrogate
one’s claim to speak at all; for a life, however
meagre, has something unique and essential
to convey, and while one delights in the artist
observation, the vivid pictorial touch, it must
not be divorced from the subjective. The
poems of Miss Hall are happily blended of the
objective and subjective; here, for illustration,
<!--361.png-->
is a lighter note bringing one in thrall to that
seductive, tantalizing charm, that irresistible
allurement, of the Vita Nuova of the year:</p>

<p>tempers this blitheness to a pensive strain,

<p>One nature lyric of two stanzas, despite the
fact that its cadence halts in the final couplet,
is compact of atmosphere; and to one who has
been companioned by the pines, it brings an
aromatic breath, full of stimulus:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The sun in the pine is sleeping, sleeping.</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">The drops of resin gleam….</div>

</div><!--end container-->

<p>These lines give over pictures of mornings in
the radiant sunlight of the North, that cloudless,
lifted air; and “The drops of resin gleam,”
has the same touch of transmutation that some
suggestion of the brine has for the exiled native
of the seaboard.</p>

<p>Miss Hall’s themes are not sought far afield,
but bring, in nearly all the poems, a hint of
personal experience; nature, love, spiritual
emotion, blending with lighter moods and
fancies, comprise the record of the <cite>Age of
Fairygold</cite>. We have glanced at the nature
<!--363.png-->
verse; that upon love is subtler in touch, but
holds to the intimate note distinguishing all of
her work. The second of these stanzas contains
a graphic image:</p>

  <div class="verse">Be good to me! If all the world united</div>

<p>In her poem called “The Rival” human nature
speaks a direct word, particularly in the contradiction
of the last stanza. The lines have
the quality of speech rather than of print:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">This is the hardest of my fate:</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">She’s better whom he doth prefer</div>

  <div class="verse indent2">As well as so much prettier,</div>
  <div class="verse">So much more fortunate!</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">He’ll not repent; oh, you will see,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">She’ll never give him cause to grieve!</div>
  <div class="verse">I dream that he comes back to me,</div>

<p>The ethical inconsistency of the above stanza,
“I loathe her,” and “Not she alone is good,”
is so human and racy with suggestion of these
paradoxical moods of ours, that the stanza,
together with its companion lines, becomes a
leaf torn from the book of life.</p>

<p>In its spiritual quality Miss Hall’s work
shows, perhaps, its finest distinction: brave,
strong, acquiescent, inducing in one a nobler
mood,&mdash;such is the spirit of the volume. Its
philosophy is free from didacticism or moralizing;
indeed, it should scarcely be called
philosophy, but rather the personal record of
experiences touching the inner life,&mdash;phases
of feeling interpreted in their spiritual import.
These lines express the mood:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Then lead me, Friend. Here is my hand,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Not in dumb resignation lent</div>

<p>The last stanza, in its vivid illustrative quality,
is an admirable expression of spiritual
assurance.</p>

<p>Another brief lyric rings with the true note
of valor, declaring the eternal potency of hope,
and one’s obligation to pass on his unspent

<p>From an Eastern Apologue Miss Hall has
drawn a charming illustration of the power of
influence and association:</p>

  <div class="verse">“Thou smell’st not ill, thou object plain,</div>

<p>In the poems of a blither note, Miss Hall
excels, having a swift and sprightly fancy and
<!--366.png-->
a clever aptness of phrase, which, in <cite>Allegretto</cite>,
her collection of lighter verse, reveals itself in
charming witticisms and whimsicalities. Her
children’s poems are delicate in touch and
fancy, and quaintly humorous. Her lines,
“To A Weed,” in the second collection, tuck
away a moral in their sprightly comment; indeed,
a bit of philosophy as to being glad in
the sun and taking one’s due of life, despite
limitations, which renders them more than the
merry apostrophe they seem:</p>

</div><!--end container-->

<p>In the art of compression, in consistent and restrained
imagery, in clearness and simplicity,
and in freedom from affectation, Miss Hall’s
work is altogether commendable. In technique
she makes no ambitious flights, employing
almost wholly the more direct and simple forms
and metres, but these suit the intimate mood
and singing note of her themes better than
more intricate measures. Technically her chief
defect is in the disregard which she frequently
shows for the demands of metre. I say disregard,
for it is evident from the grace of
the majority of her work that she allows herself
to depart from metrical canons at her
own will, with the occasional result of jagged
lines which may have seemed more expressive
to Miss Hall than those of a smoother cadence,
but which are likely to offend the ear of one
sensitive to rhythm. These lapses are not,
however, so frequent or conspicuous as to constitute
a general indictment against the work.</p>

<p>The reflective predominates over the imaginative
in the <cite>Age of Fairygold</cite>, notwithstanding
the suggestion of the title. Indeed, there is a
<!--368.png-->
subtly pensive note running through the volume,
which remains in one’s mind as a characteristic
impression when the lighter notes are forgotten.
They are not poems of vivid color, imagination,
nor passion, though touched with all. They
are not incrusted with verbal gems, though
the diction is fitting and graceful. They have
no daringly inventive metres, though the form
is always in harmony with the thought,&mdash;in
short, the poems of Miss Hall are such as
please and satisfy without startling. They are
leaves from the book of the heart, and admit us
to many a kindred experience. These lines,
in which we must take leave of them, carry
the wistful, tender, sympathetic note, which distinguishes
much of her work:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Though true it be these splendid dreams of mine</div>
  <div class="verse">Are but as bubbles little children blow,</div>
  <div class="verse">And that Fate laughs to see them wax and shine,</div>
  <div class="verse">Then holds out her pale finger&mdash;and they go:</div>
  <div class="verse">One bitter drop falls with a tear-like gleam,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">Still, dreaming is so sweet! Still, let me dream!</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Though true, to love may be definéd thus:</div>
  <div class="verse">To open wide your safe defenceless hall</div>
  <div class="verse">To some great guest full-armed and dangerous,</div>
  <div class="verse">With power to ravage, to deface it all,</div>
  <div class="verse">A cast at dice, whether or no he will,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">Still, loving is so sweet! Let me love still!</div>

<h4>ARTHUR UPSON</h4>

<p class="p2 dropcap">WHEN a volume of verse by Mr.
Arthur Upson, entitled <cite>Octaves In
An Oxford Garden</cite>, was first brought
to my notice by a poet friend with what seemed
before reading it a somewhat extravagant comment
as to its art, it evoked a certain scepticism
as to whether the poet in question would
be equally enthusiastic, had he read, marked,
learned, and inwardly digested some eighty or
more volumes of verse within a given period,
thus rendering a more rarely flavored compound
necessary to excite anew the poetry-sated
appetite; but Mr. Upson’s Octaves proved to
be a brew into which had fallen this magic
drop, and moments had gone the way of oblivion
until the charm was drained.</p>

<p>The volume consists of some thirty Octaves
written in Wadham Garden at Oxford in the
reminiscent month of September; and so do
they fix the mood of the place that one marvels
at the restfulness, the brooding stillness, the
<!--370.png-->
flavor of time and association which Mr. Upson
has managed to infuse into his musing,
sabbatical lines. One regrets that the term
“atmosphere” has become so cheapened, for in
the exigent moment when no other will serve
as well, he has the depressing consciousness
that virtue has gone from the word he must
employ. Despite this fact, it is atmosphere, in
its most pervasive sense, that imbues Mr. Upson’s
Octaves, as the first will attest:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The day was like a Sabbath in a swoon.</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Under late summer’s blue were fair cloud-things</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Poising aslant upon their charméd wings,</div>
  <div class="verse">Arrested by some backward thought of June.</div>
  <div class="verse">Softly I trod and with repentant shoon,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Half fearfully in sweet imaginings,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Where lay, as might some golden court of kings,</div>
  <div class="verse">The old Quadrangle paved with afternoon.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>What else than a touch of genius is in those
three words, “paved with afternoon,” as fixing
the tempered light, the drowsy calm, of the
place?</p>

<p>The Octaves are written in groups, the
poems of each having a slight dependence upon
one another, so that to be quoted they require
the connecting thought. In many cases also
the first or the second quatrain of the Octave
is more artistic than its companion lines, as in
<!--371.png-->
the one which follows, where the first four lines
hold the creative beauty:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">As here among the well-remembering boughs,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Where every leaf is tongue to ancient breath,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Speech of the yesteryears forgathereth,</div>
  <div class="verse">And all the winds are long-fulfilléd vows&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">So from of old those ringing names arouse</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">A whispering in the foliate shades of death,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Where History her golden rosary saith,</div>
  <div class="verse">Glowing, the light of Memory on her brows.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>This Octave illustrates also what may be
made as a general statement regarding its companions
in the volume, that while the glamour
may not rest equally upon the poems, they do
not lack charm and distinction even in their
less creative touches; and there are few in
which there does not lurk some surprise in
the way of picturesque phrasing.</p>

<p>In the ordering of his cadences Mr. Upson
shows a musician’s sense of rhythm; note,
for example, how the transposition in the
following lines enhances their melody and conveys
in the initial one the sense of a river
flowing:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">It was the lip of murmuring Thames along</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">When new lights sought the wood all strangely fair,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Such quiet lights as saints transfigured wear</div>
  <div class="verse">In minster windows crept the glades among.</div>
<!--372.png-->
  <div class="verse">And far as from some hazy hill, yet strong,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Methought an upland shepherd piped it there,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Waking a silvern echo from her lair:</div>
  <div class="verse">“Sweet Thames, run softly till I end my song!”</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Mr. Upson not only obeys by artist instinct
the laws of counterpoint, but employs the
word with the music in it, and his effects are
achieved by the innate harmony of his diction
and the poetry in the theme he is shaping.
Take as an illustration of this his Octave
upon the “Roman Glassware Preserved in the
Ashmolean.” Doubtless those fragments of
crystal, sheathed, by centuries in the earth, in a
translucent film through which shine tints of
mother-of-pearl, have met the eyes of many
of us, but it needed a poet to deduce from them
this illustration:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Fair crystal cups are dug from earth’s old crust,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Shattered but lovely, for, at price of all</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Their shameful exile from the banquet-hall,</div>
  <div class="verse">They have been bargaining beauties from the dust.</div>
  <div class="verse">So, dig my life but deep enough, you must</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Find broken friendships round its inner wall&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Which once my careless hand let slip and fall&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">Brave with faint memories, rich in rainbow-rust!</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>One notes in Mr. Upson’s work a restraint
that is the apogee of good taste. He conveys
the mood, whether of love or other emotion,
<!--373.png-->
and makes his feeling another’s, but the veil of
the temple is never wholly rent; one may but
divine the ministries and sacrifices of its altar.
He is an idealist, not yet come to the place of
disillusion; though wandering at times near to
the border of that chilly realm, he wraps his
seamless robe of dreams more closely about
him and turns back. Mr. Upson is not, however,
an unthinking singer to whom all is cheer
because he has not the insight to enter into
those phases of life that have not yet touched
him; on the contrary, his note is not a blithe one,
it is meditative, inclining to the philosophical,
and tinctured with a certain pensiveness.</p>

<p>Now and again the cosmos thrusts forward a
suggestion which becomes the motive of one of
the Octaves, as when the garden breeze loosens
from the chink a</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse indent4"> … measure of earth</div>
  <div class="verse">To match my body’s dust when its rebirth</div>
  <div class="verse">To sod restores old functions I forsook,&mdash;</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>which, in turn, induces a reflection upon the
microcosm:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Strange that a sod for just a thrill or two</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Should ever be seduced into the round</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Of change in which its present state is found</div>
  <div class="verse">In this my form! forsake its quiet, true</div>
<!--374.png-->
  <div class="verse">And fruitfullest retirement, to go through</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">The heat, the strain, the languor and the wound!</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Forget soft rain to hear the stormier sound,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">Exchange for burning tears its peaceful dew!</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Again one has the applied illustration both
of the pains and requitals that cling about the
sod in its “strange estate of flesh,” in these
lines declaring that</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Some dust of Eden eddies round us yet.</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Some clay o’ the Garden, clinging in the breast,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Down near the heart yet bides unmanifest.</div>
  <div class="verse">Last eve in gardens strange to me I let</div>
  <div class="verse">The path lead far; and lo, my vision met</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Old forfeit hopes. I, as on homeward quest,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">By recognizing trees was bidden rest,</div>
  <div class="verse">And pitying leaves looked down and sighed, “Forget!”</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Mr. Upson has one of his characteristic touches
in the words “old forfeit hopes,” pictured as
starting suddenly before one in the new path
that has beguiled him. In looking over the Octaves,
which embrace a variety of themes, one
doubts if his selections have adequately represented
the finely textured lines, pure and individual
diction, and the ripe and mellow flavor
of it all.</p>

<p>Mr. Upson’s work has had its meed of recognition
abroad: his first volume, <cite>Westwind Songs</cite>,
contained a warmly appreciative introduction by
<!--375.png-->
“Carmen Sylva,” the poet-queen of Roumania,
and his drama, <cite>The City</cite>, just issued in Edinburgh,
is introduced by Count Lützow of the
University of Prague, a well-known scholar
and authority upon Bohemian literature. Taking
a backward glance at the first volume
before looking at <cite>The City</cite>, one finds few of
the ear-marks of a first collection of poetry,
which it must become the subsequent effort
of the writer to live down.</p>

<p>The lines “When We Said Good-Bye” are
among the truest in feeling, though almost
too intimate to quote; and this sympathetic
lyric, entitled “Old Gardens,” has a delicate
grace:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">The white rose tree that spent its musk</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">For lovers’ sweeter praise,</div>
  <div class="verse">The stately walks we sought at dusk,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Have missed thee many days.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Again, with once-familiar feet,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">I tread the old parterre&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">But, ah, its bloom is now less sweet</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Than when thy face was there.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">I hear the birds of evening call;</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">I take the wild perfume;</div>

<!--376.png-->

<p><cite>Westwind Songs</cite>, however, waft other thoughts
than those of love. There is a heavier freight
in this “Thought of Stevenson”:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">High and alone I stood on Calton Hill</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Above the scene that was so dear to him</div>

  <div class="verse">October wooed the folded valleys till</div>
  <div class="verse">In mist they blurred, even as our eyes upfill</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Under a too sweet memory; spires did swim,</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">And gables rust-red, on the gray sea’s brim&mdash;</div>
  <div class="verse">But on these heights the air was soft and still.</div>
  <div class="verse">Yet not all still: an alien breeze did turn</div>
  <div class="verse indent2">Here as from bournes in aromatic seas,</div>
  <div class="verse">As round old shrines a new-freed soul might yearn</div>

<p>How fine is the imaginative thought of
October wooing the valleys till they blurred

<p>So one might imagine the journeying winds
blowing hither from Vaea, and the intensely
human soul of Stevenson yearning to the vital
sympathies of earth.</p>

<p>Mr. Upson has recently published in Edinburgh
<!--377.png-->
and America a poem-drama entitled <cite>The
City</cite>, and containing, as previously mentioned,
a scholarly introduction by Count Lützow of
the Bohemian University of Prague, who points
out the historical and traditional sources of the
story.</p>

<p>The drama is embraced in one act, and covers
a period of but one day, from dawn to dusk;
nevertheless, it is not wanting in incident, since
its operative causes reach their culmination in
this period. The “conditions precedent” of
the plot, briefly summarized, show that Abgar,
King of Edessa, has married Cleonis, an Athenian,
whose foster-sister, Stilbe, having been an
earlier favorite of the king, is actuated by jealousy
of the pair, and although dwelling as an
inmate of the royal household, plots with her
lover, Belarion, against the government of the
king, ill at his palace outside the city and
awaiting the arrival of Jesus to heal him of
his disease.</p>

<p>The subjects of Abgar have rebelled not only
at his protracted absence from the city, in dalliance,
as they deem it, with the Athenian queen,
but because of measures of reform instituted
by him which had done despite to their ancient
idolatries and desecrated certain shrines in the
public improvements of the city.</p>

<!--378.png-->
<p>Not only had the king progressed beyond
his day in the material advancement of his
realm, but his eager, swiftly conceiving mind
had imaged a spiritual ideal even more vital;
and at the opening of the drama he awaits the
coming of the Nazarene to heal him, that he may
devote himself to the development of his people.</p>

<p>The scene opens at the dawn in the portico
of the palace, where the queen’s women, attired
in white pepli, have spent the night singing
soft music to the accompaniment of the lyre to
charm the fevered sleep of the king. They are
dismissed by Agamede, cousin of the queen,
who detains Stilbe to learn the cause of her
discontent. Sufficient is revealed to indicate that
Belarion, the betrothed of Stilbe, whom the
oracle has declared a man of promise, is plotting
against the life of the king, aided in this
design by Stilbe, who has been summoned almost
from the marriage altar to attend the queen.</p>

<p>The second scene takes place four hours
later, in the palace garden, and pictures the
return of the messenger and his attendants
sent to conduct Jesus to Edessa. The opening
dialogue occurs between Ananias, the
returned messenger, and the old and learned
doctor of the court, who details with elaborate
minuteness the ministries of his skill since the
<!--379.png-->
departure of the former to Jerusalem. While
this dialogue is characteristic, well phrased,
and indirectly humorous, it is a dramatic mistake
to introduce it at such length, retarding
the action, which should be focused sharply
upon the essential motive of the scene,&mdash;the
conveying to the queen the message of the
Nazarene and the incidents of his refusal.
The literary quality of the dialogue between the
queen and Ananias has much beauty, being
memorable for the picture it conveys of Jesus
among his disciples at Bethany, “a hamlet up
an olive-sprinkled hill,” where, guided by Philip,
the Galilean, the messenger found him. The
description of the personality and manner of
Christ is a subtle piece of portraiture. To the
question of Cleonis,&mdash;</p>

<p>Ere the departure of the king’s embassy from
Jerusalem, the tragic drama of the crucifixion
had been enacted and in part witnessed by them,
which Ananias also describes with graphic
force; in it appears an adaptation of the Veronica
story. The lines well convey the picture:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"> <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">As the way widened past the high-walled house</div>
  <div class="verse">Of Berenis, the throng thinned, and I saw</div>

  <div class="verse">From the great gate I saw a form dart forth</div>

  <div class="verse">With the condemned, as, by old privilege,</div>
  <div class="verse">Sometimes the pious ladies do with those</div>

  <div class="verse">She turned, and, as I saw ’twas Berenis,</div>

 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>In the third scene of the drama, occurring
in the afternoon, Abgar is informed of the
Healer’s refusal to accede to his request, but in
the presence of the queen and the attendants
assembled in the royal garden, the letter of the
Nazarene, promising healing and peace, is read
to him by the returned envoy, and at length the
linen, received from the hand of Berenis, and
upon whose folds the healing power of Christ
had been invoked, is given into the keeping of
Abgar, through whose veins, as by the visible
touch of the divine hand, the current of new
life throbs and courses. The moment is fraught
with intense reality, which Mr. Upson has kept
as much as possible to such effects as transcend
words. Just previous to the vital transformation
Abgar has said:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">I have not yet resolved the Healer’s words</div>
  <div class="verse">Into clear meaning; but their crystal soon</div>
  <div class="verse">In the still cup of contemplation may</div>
  <div class="verse">Give up its precious drug to heal our cares,&mdash;</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>but the supreme end was not wrought by contemplation,
nor could its processes be resolved
<!--382.png-->
by analysis, or other words be found to proclaim
it than the simple but thrilling exclamation:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">I feel it now! All through these withered veins</div>
  <div class="verse">I feel it bound and glow! O life, life, life!</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>From this period the incidents of the drama
develop with all the tensity of action which previous
to this scene it has lacked, giving to the
close a certain sense of crowding when compared
with the slow movement of the previous scenes
consisting chiefly of recital, well told, but with
little to enact, making the work to this point
rather a graphically related story than a drama.
The incidents which come on apace in the
latter part of the play have, to be sure, been
foreshadowed in the earlier part, but one is
scarcely prepared for the swift succession of
events, nor for their bloody character after the
sabbatical mood into which the earlier scenes
of the work have thrown him. If the drama
covered a longer period, giving time between
scenes for the development of events, even
though such development were but suggested
by a statement of dates, the impression of
undue haste in the climax would be obviated;
but in the interval of one day, even though all
events leading to the issue have been working
silently for months or years, their culmination
seems to come without due preparation to the
<!--383.png-->
reader’s mind, and one is swept off his feet by
consummations with whose causes he had
scarcely reckoned.</p>

<p>Immediately following the healing of Abgar,
the queen’s cousin, Agamede, enters breathless
and announces to the king the plot on foot to
overthrow him, which inspires the king with a
resolve to set forth at once to the city. Upon
the attempt of the queen to deter him, Abgar
relates a prophetic dream of his city and its
destiny through him, which is one of the finest
conceptions, both in spiritual import and elevation
of phrase, contained in the drama. The
dream is related as having appeared to the
king in three distinct visions, glimpsing his
city in its past, present, and future. It is too
long to follow in detail, but this glimpse is from
the vision of the past, where</p>

  <div class="verse indent2">Half sunk in sod betwixt its columns’ bases,</div>

 <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="sc">Appease with sacrifice the unknown powers.</span></div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<!--384.png-->
<p>The next vision is of the city in its present
state, “builded on like dust,” but teeming with
activity and material purpose, through which
a glimmering ideal begins to dawn:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">They toiled, or played, or fought, or sued the gods,</div>
  <div class="verse">Absorbed each in his own peculiar lust,</div>
  <div class="verse">As if there were no morrow watching them;</div>
  <div class="verse">Yet each was happier in the morrow-dream</div>
  <div class="verse">Than ever in all achievéd yesterdays.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>Then is revealed to the mind of Abgar the
high commission intrusted to him:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">And as I looked, I saw a man who long</div>
  <div class="verse">In upward meditation on his roof</div>
  <div class="verse">Sat all alone, communing with his soul,</div>
  <div class="verse">And he arose, and presently went down,</div>
  <div class="verse">Down in the long black streets among his kind,</div>
  <div class="verse">And there with patience taught them steadfastly;</div>
  <div class="verse">But, for the restless souls he made in them,</div>
  <div class="verse">They turned and slew him and went on their ways,</div>
  <div class="verse">And a great fog crept up and covered all.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>Here surely is keen spiritual psychology,
that “for the restless souls he made in them”
they slew him. All martyrdoms are traced to
their source in this line, which holds also the
suggestive truth as to the final acceptance of
that for which the prophet dies. Once having
planted the seed whose stirring makes the
“restless soul,” its growth is committed to the
<!--385.png-->
Law, and can no more be prevented than the
shining of the sun or the flowing of the tides.
Abgar was granted a third vision, of the city
in its embodied ideal; its ultimate beauty and
achievement were given definite shape before
him, and the recital ends with the triumphal
note:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Fear not for me: I go unto the city!</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>The last scene is enacted an hour later in
the garden lighted only by the moon, and opens
with the lyric sung by Agamede to the blossoming
oleander-tree ’neath which her child lies
buried. These are lines of a pathos as delicate
and spiritual as the moonlight, the fragrance,
the memory inspiring them:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Grow, grow, thou little tree,</div>
  <div class="verse">His body at the roots of thee;</div>
  <div class="verse">Since last year’s loveliness in death</div>
  <div class="verse">The living beauty nourisheth.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Bloom, bloom, thou little tree,</div>
  <div class="verse">Thy roots around the heart of me;</div>
  <div class="verse">Thou canst not blow too white and fair</div>
  <div class="verse">From all the sweetness hidden there.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Die, die, thou little tree,</div>
  <div class="verse">And be as all sweet things must be;</div>
  <div class="verse">Deep where thy petals drift I, too,</div>
  <div class="verse">Would rest the changing seasons through.</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<!--386.png-->
<p>Then follows a dialogue of warmly emotional
feeling between the king and queen, in the interval
of waiting for the chariot and attendants
to be brought to the gate. All the physical
side of the healing of Abgar has now been
resolved into its spiritual meaning, and he
reinterprets the words of the Nazarene’s message
that of his infirmity he shall know full cure
and those most dear to him have peace; but
while Abgar speaks of his changed ideal, looking
now to a “city which hath foundations,
whose builder and maker is God,” a clamor is
heard at the gate, and the body-slave rushes
to the king with the tidings that armed troops
approach the palace, and begs him to flee in the
waiting chariot. Spurning thought of escape,
the king and queen mount the dais and stand
calmly watching in the moonlight the heroic
spectacle of the approaching army. At this
moment the queen’s women rush into the
garden, demanding flight; the conflict begins
along the wall; the gate bursts open, and Ananias
retreats to the garden, wounded, and
shortly dies. A brief interval of quiet, but full
of portent, succeeds, when Stilbe, who had plotted
with the king’s enemies, rushes through
the gate, pursued by the soldiers and bleeding
from wounds of their sabres. She is shot, apparently
<!--387.png-->
by the hand of her former lover, Belarion,
and falls dead at the king’s feet. Here
Mr. Upson leaves an unravelled thread of his
plot, or at least one for whose clew I have
sought vainly. No cause has been shown for
violence toward her on the part of the soldiers
whom she aids, nor on that of her supposed
lover and betrothed, Belarion. Why, then, she
should become his victim, or why he should
look upon her dead body and exclaim:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">“Thus Fate helps out!”</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>is at least a riddle past my solving. If, as the
results indicate, Belarion has been using Stilbe
as a tool to aid his ambitions, it should scarcely
have been related in good faith in the beginning
of the drama that their marriage was to be
celebrated the week in which the action of the
play falls. If logical reasons exist for this
change of front, Mr. Upson should have indicated
them more clearly.</p>

<p>The climax of the play follows immediately
upon the death of Stilbe, when the king, called
to account by the insolent Belarion, in righteous
indignation strikes him down. It may be
questioned whether such a deed could follow so
quickly upon the rapt spiritual state to which
the king had been lifted; but one inclines to
<!--388.png-->
rejoice that the natural man, impelled by who
shall say what higher force, triumphed, ere
the queen, pointing to the dead body of the
trusted messenger, Ananias, and repeating
the Nazarene’s words, “Those most dear to
you have peace,”&mdash;demanded of the king his
blade.</p>

<p>As they stand defenceless but assured, the
soldiers, awed by the might of some inner force
in the king, shrink back, and the drama closes
with the victorious words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="verse">Together, Love, we go unto the city!</div>
 </div><!--end stanza-->
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end poem container-->

<p>Though the play, looked upon from a dramatic
standpoint, lacks in the earlier scenes a
certain magnetism of touch and vividness of
action, and in the last scene is somewhat overcharged
with them, it has many finely conceived
situations which strike the golden mean,
and the characterization throughout is strongly
defined. Its literary quality must, however,
take precedence of its dramatic in the truer appraisal.
In diction it shows none of the strained
effort toward the supposed speech of an earlier
time, which usually distinguishes poetic dramas
laid far in the past, but has throughout a fitting
dignity and harmony, combined with ease and
flexibility of phrase and frequent eloquence of
<!--389.png-->
dialogue, especially in the passages spoken by
Abgar.</p>

<p>It is a play rather of character and high
motive than of plot, a piece of sheer idealism,
notable alike for its spiritual and its
poetic quality.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<h2>START: FULL LICENSE<br />
<br />
THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>

<p>For additional contact information:</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
